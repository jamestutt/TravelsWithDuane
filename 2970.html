<H1>Diary for Dion and Duane</H1><hr size='1'><H2>The North Island.</H2><H3>2007-08-24 to 2007-08-26</H3><P>From Wellington we drove to Taumatawhakatanginangakoavavotamateaturipukakapikimaungahoronukupokaiwhenvakitanatahu which claims to have the logest name in the world (ousting the train station in Whales) and I believe it does however the only thing here is a sign in a layby giving its name and a hill in the distance and obviously a couple of sheep. So we drove on and spent the night in Napier a town eith a love afair with the art-deco. The next day we drove on up past lake Taupo to Rotorua and walked amougnst the pools of bubbling mud and enjoying the sulphuric air caused by local volcanic activity. That night we stayed in Tongariro National Park at the foot of Mount Doom, well that`s what the elves call it. The next day we headed back towards Wellington and stayed in Upper Hutt.</P><hr size='1'>
