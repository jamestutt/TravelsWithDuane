<H1>Diary for Dion and Duane</H1><hr size='1'><H2>The French Riviera</H2><H3>2007-02-28 to 2007-03-01</H3><P>We got off the train from Florence in Monaco expecting to spend the day here however having discovered that there was nowhere to leave our bags at the station - a note for all you would be travellers - we stepped back on the train and stepped off again in Nice. Dropping our bags at our hotel - yes, hotel - we lunched on the sea front on the old favourite of baguette, cheese and ham before returning to Monaco with a little less luggage. Having spent a while window shoppinh for luxury yachts we raced around the Monte Carlo grand prix circuit - alas, on foot - and popped into the casino en route and managed to stay my hand from the roulette table. Looking for more amusement we ascended the hill and stopped a while outside the royal palace and then headed back to Nice. On the beech in Nice the waters looked warma and inviting however having jumped in i found that i had been decieved and that the Mad can be cold in February. So i warmed myself up again with a couple of beers then headed back to the hotel, picking up a pizza along the way to catch up on my favourite French soap - La plus belle vie - and the auditions stages of Nouvelle Star (French pop idol). After an early night we were forced out of bed to get the 8.33 from Nice to Marseille where we lunched at the airport before flying back to London.</P><hr size='1'>
