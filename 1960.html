<H1>Diary for Dion and Duane</H1><hr size='1'><H2>The gateway to India</H2><H3>2007-03-06 to 2007-03-09</H3><P>After a cramped long flight, all you really want is a cold shower and a chance to catch up on some lost sleep.  Welcome to Mumbai.  It`s the middle of the day (only 40 degrees) and you have no idea where you are or how to get to your hostel.  Unfortuantely that also seems true for the taxi drivers.  
</P><P>
</P><P>The roads have few street names and the drivers are all manically insane, but with the help of a few locals we manage to find our hostel and prepare ourselves for our Mumbai experience.
</P><P>
</P><P>It doesn`t seem too busy, but then we discover that we are infact 30 minutes by train from the tourist centre.  A sense of dread appeared as we imagined what an Indian train might be like, but it was fairly empty with ceiling fans (standing room only) but a very efficient means of transport.
</P><P>
</P><P>To cross the raod in Mumbai is to take your life into your own hands, but at any crossing point eventually the numbers become large enough for the cars to have to stop or cause a massacre.  The sights of Mumbai are not numerous and the food and drink is "expensive" but we had some fun experiences.  Being white gets you stared at in Mumbai, being outlandishly tall gets people not looking away when you catch their eye and walking alongside you for miles just to get a comparison.  They are all friendly about it and you can have some entertaining conversations in broken English with them as you walk.
</P><P>
</P><P>The rickshaw.  A most noble means of transportation and several were used in our hunt for the consulate of Vietnam.  There isn`t one (and if there is i don`t want to hear about it.  I enjoy my ignorance), but at least we managed to accost a hospital porter to aid us in our search.  he didn`t even want a tip.......most unusual!!!
</P><P>
</P><P>To avid the general pandemonium of the city we also took some time to explore the wonders of elephante island (the British removed the statue of the elephant that gave the island its name, but strangely didn`t put it in the British museum!?!).  Lots of caves, monkeys and cows.  It was nice to be able to sit somewhere and not have someone try to sell you a giant inflatable balloon or magnets.
</P><P>
</P><P>The train home showed Indian trains to be exactly what you would expect.  The war cries as you entered a station from people about to board, the pushing, holding on for dear life and then off goes the train again.  I felt like a battery farmed chicken, but got to talk to lots of Indians about cricket (they rarely talk about anything else).
</P><P>
</P><P>Mumbai.....we probably spent too long there given what it had to offer, but certainly an experince i will remember and even, most of the time, enjoyed.
</P><P>
</P><P>I will put photos up at some point, but this computer and my camera don`t seem to get on.......i`ll get them to talk it out over lunch.</P><hr size='1'>
