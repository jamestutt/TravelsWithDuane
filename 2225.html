<H1>Diary for Dion and Duane</H1><hr size='1'><H2>Ha Long Bay.</H2><H3>2007-04-18 to 2007-04-20</H3><P>We were woken up early and piled onto a minibus to be wisked off to the coast. We stoped off half way in a car park with the greatest population of Westerners that i had seen in a very long time. When we arrived at the harbour we were hurded onto a boat and seated for lunch. The bay is ruptured by 1,969 natural, limestone monoliths and so is quite a sight for tired eyes. Firstly our boat took us to a system of caves within one of these obelisks. Having spent a timw trying to identify the swooping dragons and young lovers that our guide claimed to see among the stalactites we reborded the boat and spent the afternoon drifting amound the rocks. After sunset and, perhaps more importantly, dinner we spent the evening anchored in a lagoon beneeth the stars, drinking lager and cheep vodka while making merry with our band of fellow adventurers. The next morning came too late for canoeing as we awoke to see the other guests returning from their mornings activity (it was still only 06:30). After breakfast the boat dropped us off on Cat Ba Island where we were lead on a treck. Up through the cliffs we were led and down into a modest jungle before rising again to the top of a mountain. At this point I decided to discuss the pros and cons of shopping at Trago Mills with a girl from Devon. After noon we were taken to our hotel on the island from which we gat a boat to Monkey Island were we swam, canoed and avoided jelly fish while watching other tourists avoiding the monkeys. The evening was spent in Cat Ba town - a sort of poor man`s Blackpool - before hitting the sack and awaiting dawn. The next morning we were picked up from the hotel at taken by boat back to the main land where, after lunch we were driven back to Hanoi.</P><hr size='1'>
