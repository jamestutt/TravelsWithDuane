<H1>Diary for Dion and Duane</H1><hr size='1'><H2>Varanasi: Holy Cow!</H2><H3>2007-04-05 to 2007-04-07</H3><P>The tuc-tuc got us as far as it could but before too long the driver could go no further. The allyways of Varanasi are a tight compact network of ancient cobbles full of ancient charm that time dare not traverse. The city claims to be the oldest continually used settlement in the world and the multiple layers of dust and dirt testify well to this. As our driver retreated to the safty of the more recently developed byways we entered the maze that at times reminded me of the Laberynthine goblin city and at time the worst recesses of the Arndale centre. Wondering cows would bloke our parth forcing us to persue a different course where colourful fruit peddlers would retard our passage vending their fly-ridden morsels. To my right a painted yogi sat chanting his mantras while to my left a small child earnestly beckoned me to look in his shop "looking is free", he added. As we entered our room however before us was a panoramic expanse of sand and sky while in the fore ground the mighty Ganges slowly and ominously rolled along. We were staying in the turret of a castle built in the 16th centry by the Maharana of Udaipur and the room was perfect. It was the world of Scheherazade`s 1001 nights combined with the baking heat of the Sahara. We wondered up the Ghats that line the river bank watching devout Hindus washing away their mortal sins in Ganga that holiest of rivers as it flowed though Shiva`s city. We had arranged to meet Damelza so i got on the phone. " Where are you?". " I`m standing in an alyway next to a cow", came the crackling reply down the line. "We must be close then", said I, "for i`m in an alyway next to a cow too!". Having met our macabre cruiosity led us to the burning Ghat where the most fortunate Hindus are publicaly cremated on pyres of Sandlewood before having their ashes swept into the stream. The fires burn 24 hours a day consuming in this period 300 corpses. Only the most pure bodies, that have never known the company of a woman - children and gurus - may be interred in the waters whole. The final act of the ceremony is to smash the skulls of the deceased allowing the pure soul exit from the mortal realm. After this we sat down to drink a Pepsi and reflect on Life and Death. After a brief repose we were led back into the alyways by a guy called Sanjay to a Golden temple were i was begarlened with lotus flowers and had ash spread over my forehead as i lay prostrate with my head on a Linga for potency in later life. Varanesi is certainly a city of contrasts and a voyeur`s paradise.</P><hr size='1'>
