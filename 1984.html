<H1>Diary for Dion and Duane</H1><hr size='1'><H2>Goa`way</H2><H3>2007-03-22 to 2007-03-27</H3><P>After managing to escape Anjuna and its rustic hippie charm (with a lot of help from Demelza), we arrived on the sun-drenched, postcard picture beaches of Palolem.  It has everything a holiday maker could want for a winter retreat to the sun.  Idyllic beaches, a shore line covered with cheap bars and restaurants and quirky accommodation as far as the eye could see.  This does however bring an unwholesome variety of traveller to the area.  Affectionately named 10 dayers by my esteemed travelling companion, they can be seen from sunrise (I could have seen them, but its a very detrimental time of day to be up) to sunset basking like giant reptiles in the baking sun.  After disappearing for a few joyous hours (I can but assume they are busy applying aftersun) they reappear, pinker than the day before and ready to sample the finest food and cocktails that Goa has to offer.

</P><P>Palolem has one late night bar and this is where the Brits file in, already staggering in and out of the sea, to finish their nights off with some overly strong rum and cokes and, if it tickles their fancy, a fight.  Brits abroad hey!
</P><P>
</P><P>They are of course a minority and the people you meet in south Goa are incredibly friendly.  The staff in the restaurants speak perfect English and are always eager to help.  The shop owners hassle you for a few less hours than on the beach in Anjuna and if you want nothing more than to lie in the sun and swim in a warm sea then it is perfect.
</P><P>
</P><P>Being restless types however, we decided to have an explore.  There is one main road behind the beach and a small market.  A good way to kill an hour or two and plenty of nice  bars (even an English pub!!!!!!!).  The evenings were always entertaining with one or more of the bars having live music, beach fires and happy hours and we could often be found in the early hours of the morning with Demelza and our new chum Laura, lying on the sand, gazing at the stars and putting the world to rights.
</P><P>
</P><P>The problem with Goa is that it is incredibly easy to get used to doing absolutely nothing but sit on the beach and so planning your escape takes a concerted effort.  It was decided the best way out would be a sleeper coach from Chaudi to Bangalore (anything to avoid going anywhere near Mumbai!).  This meant 15 hours sharing a bed the size of a small single (designed for people of a shorter stature) with a fellow traveller.  I was lucky, I got Demelza, Duane had to make do with a thoroughly nice Indian.
</P><P>
</P><P>A restless night of being launched into the air after every bump followed until we arrived safe, if a little sore into Bangalore.  How on earth are we going to get to Delhi.</P><hr size='1'>
