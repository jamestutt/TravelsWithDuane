<H1>Diary for Dion and Duane</H1><hr size='1'><H2>Cheers Lee.</H2><H3>2007-03-29 to 2007-04-01</H3><P>The number of times i`ve had to rewrite these Diary entries because computers find it terribly amusing to delete them just as they are about to be saved will diving me to murder. My apologies to the computer technician i just shouted at if you happen to be reading this. As i was saying before the computer devoured my words. We got the night bus from Palolem to Bangalore and having packed Demelza off to an Ashram with a suspected neo-Nazi, Dion and i made our way to Cubbon Park and wasted away the afternoon playing chess. After a refreshing pomegranate juice and half a game of Top Trumps we bumped into Lee Parnel a friend from my uni days at Bath, who now happened to be in Bangalore working for Reuters. It is quite impossible to express the feelings roused as one stumbles back into reality after spending weeks nomadically. We watched TV. Since we were in India we ordered an English take-away and were served the most delightful food mine and Dion`s combined imagination was incapable of imagining. After dinner and a good, warm, spider / cockroach free shower we headed into Bangalore to experience the India high life. The 13th floor bar is a bar aptly named because of its location on the 13th floor of a shopping mall. Sitting on the roof terrace over looking the vast sprawling city we rubbed shoulders with the creme de la creme of South India`s yuppie classes, most of who, i`m sure, thought we could have showered a bit more. The next day we got up late (well those who didn`t have to be at work at 9 got up late) and watched more TV. Then we took a tuc-tuc to Reuters and were treated to lunch at the 5* Leela Palace Hotel (where they even air-condition the gardens and put fresh rose petals in the fountains daily).  We wasted the rest of the day wondering around the Botanical Garden before catching the 42 hour train to Delhi. For the next two days Dion read Catch 22 and Moby Dick and i read Crime and Punishment.</P><hr size='1'>
