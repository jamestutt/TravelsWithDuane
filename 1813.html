<H1>Diary for Dion and Duane</H1><hr size='1'><H2>Damming it up</H2><H3>2007-02-09 to 2007-02-13</H3><P>Amsterdam and the long awaited birthday weekend.  The train journey from Paris (being the first taken by day) was long and tedious, but we arrived safe and sound and got aquainted with the wonderfully efficient tram system.
</P><P>
</P><P>What a lot of cannals and alley ways and clearly the dutch don`t like building things straight up (must be something to do with their state of mind at the time).  So we found our hostel, dumped our bags and got aquainted with the city.
</P><P>
</P><P>After a wander through Dam and lots of side streets for a bit of window shopping we felt it only sensible to take in some of the local produce and so had a pint of Guinness (what a way to feel at home).
</P><P>
</P><P>Duane`s birthday arrived after a night attempting to converse with a group pf Spanish in our hostel (safe to say their English was a lot better than my Spanish, but that`s not saying much.  I couldn`t help but feel they spent a lot of their time laughing in my general direction)
</P><P>
</P><P>So what to do on a birthday in Dam.  After days of trecking around European cities we felt it best, after a coffee and some breakfast to settle in and watch the rugby (England are still crap) and then have a steak and enjoy a few beers in some of Amsterdams more reputable bars.  Having mastered the alleyways we wandered back to the hostel for some more banter with the Spanish.
</P><P>
</P><P>With a day of relaxation behind us we felt it was time to better our minds with a trip to he science museum.  most of the explanations were in Dutch (as was the film we watched on cells), but with a reasonable grounding in the sciences I was able to convey much of what was going on to my learned companion.  The only problem was it felt odd to be playing with experiments surrounded by lots of little Dutch children.  A certain way to make you feel old.  Having splashed out the previous night we bought some cheap beer and settled in playing cards and getting quietly drunk.
</P><P>
</P><P>My birthday arrived (thanks for the messages) and so we decided to get as depressed as possible by begining our European tour of the plight of the Jews at the Anne Frank museum.  A pleasant start to the birthday.  With Duane having got sick of me bullying him to write the next section of the blog (as you can see it takes a while to get round to it) we spent some time wih the internet, however the computer with the near completed blog on crashed just before it could be uploaded.  What a crap start to the day.
</P><P>
</P><P>Something had to give and so beer was bought and from then on in, much merriment was had.  We said farwell to the girls of Amesterdam and headed back to the hostel to prepare for our day train to Berlin and the start of a hectic trip trough Nazi Germany and the plight of the Jews.
</P><P>
</P><P>A very chilled time in liberal Amsterdam (do they actually have a legal system?) and the end of an action packed week in Europe.  The Dutch do like to cycle.  Time to head East.</P><hr size='1'>
