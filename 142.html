<H1>Diary for Dion and Duane</H1><hr size='1'><H2>And so it begins</H2><H3>2007-02-03 to 2007-02-04</H3><P>Well, I find myself in Spain, at a computer in a very clean hostel with a hangover.  How best to piece together what happened yesterday.  It´s safe to say that 4 am is a time created by an old testament God and is a time neither I nor Duane ever wish to frequent again.
</P><P>
</P><P>So Barcelona.  A remarkably beautiful city, but i fear Gaudi was a touch mad.  They call it art and it certainly draws the eye.  The Sagrada Familia is a beautiful church, but after all this time i really feel they should have got round to finishing it.  Just lazy if you ask me.
</P><P>
</P><P>Spent the rest of the day wondering aound parks, going to see the sea and spending money climbing just about any momument we could.  Bad news for the budget, but we have decided to fast for a while so no doubt we will make it up.
</P><P>
</P><P>In the evening we walked for miles to go to the Font Magica just off Plaça d´Espanya to watch the coloured fountains while listening to classical music.  I´m begining to feel very cultured and if anyone comes to Barcelona it would be up there in my list of things to do.
</P><P>
</P><P>Several bottles of wine later and some dancing in the street, we managed to negotiate the metro system home.  I´m sure it didn´t need to be as hard as in was, but I blame the language barrier.</P><hr size='1'><H2>Apologies for spelling i`m a little drunk, Duane.</H2><H3>2007-02-04 to 2007-02-09</H3><P>Well, well, well ... i have finally been made to take an hour out of busy schedule to inform all you misserable chaps chapettesque what i`ve been doing while you no doubt have been working (or not). After that first night in Barcelona we awoke with a moderate hangover and decided to have a picnic in somesort of Gaudiesque park (lovely). Then walked about in order to compose ourself for a couple of drinks in the evening in another park (notice a theme developing). In the evening`s park we watched a couple of young Spanish couples learn to tango in a band stand ... and ...?... well it was a long time ago. The next day we went to the Neu Camp but felt a little tired and so did not take on the might of Barcelona (although it was clear that we would have been the stronger side). More Parks ... and a train to Paris over night.
</P><P>
</P><P>Right Paris. Dawn broke in Paris and found us already sipping coffee and eating croissants with an effortlessly Parisian manner in a cafe close to the Garre du Nord. Having ditched our bags at our Paris address we climbed the streets of Monmartre to get our first glimpse of our new city.
</P><P>
</P><P>With arough route etched out in our minds we returned to street level and proceeded to make a grand tour of the city. We spent the day fullfilling our duty as tourists and having our photos taken about such monuments as the sacre cour, the louvre, the arc de triumph (which we ascended and ammused ourselves with the traffic), the tour d`Eiffel, the statue of Libertry (French edition) and the grand gothic eddifice of Notre-Dame de Paris.
</P><P>
</P><P>Dinner was already arranged at Chartier - a restaurant that is without doubt the most charming in the whole of the French capital. Here we feasted on snails, steak, fish and cheese flushed down with a fine bottle of vin rouge.
</P><P>
</P><P>Aquiring a taste for the finner things in life we hioked back up Monmartre and sat drinking plus vin and gazing over the city below.
</P><P>
</P><P>Morning. Hangover. Recovery - art. There is a small gallery on the Seine that reached international fame through the pages of Dan Brown. The Louvre is famous for its enormous collection of disappointing masterpieces. Having, however, discovered one or two gems amoungst the throng of discerning American art lovers battling for a glimspe of da Vinci`s "anti-climax in blue and green," we realised that the day was spent and our bed did beckon.
</P><P>
</P><P>RIght kids, last day. thanks for sticking with me. What was left ... ah yes the tower. Up and down was made quite tricky by the wind but with determination we scalled and at the top i won Eiffel tower top trumps. success.
</P><P>
</P><P>Having spied the chuch containing the mortal remains of Napolean from the top we thought it our British duty to make sure the Corsican was not up to any of his trade mark mischief. As we walked down the champs de Mars, however, the skies behind the Eiffel tower grew very dark. As we turned into the church yard the hevans opened and a terrifying torent was unleashed upon us. By the time we made to ascend the steps of the church hail stones the size of musket balls were frustrating our advance and determination. That no Englishman should disturb the slumber of Napolean was surely the message sent from the skies and so we ducked down an alyway for a coffee. Within seconds of our tack once more the sun appeared to smile upon our stay with the French. SO with climatic civility restored and the Entante Cordiale intact we skipped back through the puddles of the churchyard wistleing `Rule Britannia` and leaving Bonaparte well alone.
</P><P>
</P><P>We finished our stay in Paris the way it began. On the slopes of Monmartre drinking wine and singing.</P><hr size='1'><H2>Damming it up</H2><H3>2007-02-09 to 2007-02-13</H3><P>Amsterdam and the long awaited birthday weekend.  The train journey from Paris (being the first taken by day) was long and tedious, but we arrived safe and sound and got aquainted with the wonderfully efficient tram system.
</P><P>
</P><P>What a lot of cannals and alley ways and clearly the dutch don`t like building things straight up (must be something to do with their state of mind at the time).  So we found our hostel, dumped our bags and got aquainted with the city.
</P><P>
</P><P>After a wander through Dam and lots of side streets for a bit of window shopping we felt it only sensible to take in some of the local produce and so had a pint of Guinness (what a way to feel at home).
</P><P>
</P><P>Duane`s birthday arrived after a night attempting to converse with a group pf Spanish in our hostel (safe to say their English was a lot better than my Spanish, but that`s not saying much.  I couldn`t help but feel they spent a lot of their time laughing in my general direction)
</P><P>
</P><P>So what to do on a birthday in Dam.  After days of trecking around European cities we felt it best, after a coffee and some breakfast to settle in and watch the rugby (England are still crap) and then have a steak and enjoy a few beers in some of Amsterdams more reputable bars.  Having mastered the alleyways we wandered back to the hostel for some more banter with the Spanish.
</P><P>
</P><P>With a day of relaxation behind us we felt it was time to better our minds with a trip to he science museum.  most of the explanations were in Dutch (as was the film we watched on cells), but with a reasonable grounding in the sciences I was able to convey much of what was going on to my learned companion.  The only problem was it felt odd to be playing with experiments surrounded by lots of little Dutch children.  A certain way to make you feel old.  Having splashed out the previous night we bought some cheap beer and settled in playing cards and getting quietly drunk.
</P><P>
</P><P>My birthday arrived (thanks for the messages) and so we decided to get as depressed as possible by begining our European tour of the plight of the Jews at the Anne Frank museum.  A pleasant start to the birthday.  With Duane having got sick of me bullying him to write the next section of the blog (as you can see it takes a while to get round to it) we spent some time wih the internet, however the computer with the near completed blog on crashed just before it could be uploaded.  What a crap start to the day.
</P><P>
</P><P>Something had to give and so beer was bought and from then on in, much merriment was had.  We said farwell to the girls of Amesterdam and headed back to the hostel to prepare for our day train to Berlin and the start of a hectic trip trough Nazi Germany and the plight of the Jews.
</P><P>
</P><P>A very chilled time in liberal Amsterdam (do they actually have a legal system?) and the end of an action packed week in Europe.  The Dutch do like to cycle.  Time to head East.</P><hr size='1'><H2>Berliner Blog: 24 hours in the German capital.</H2><H3>2007-02-13 to 2007-02-14</H3><P>As an Aussie girl once pointed out to me in Paris there are only two things that are essential to  trip to the German capital. The Pub crawl and the walking tour. We arrived and proceeded to the meeting station for the pub crawl. ... I awoke feeling quite drunk and wearing three glow sticks around my wrist and so went to meet the people for the walking tour.
</P><P>
</P><P>The tour was excellent so good that i ended up paying for it with a substantal tip. And now my German history is well up to scratch. Did you know that Napolean had so much respect for Frederick the Great that when he marched into Berlin, at the foot of the Prussians statue he bayed his men to remove their hats instucting them that if this man were still alive they would never have entered the city. Also the Berlin wall fell through a mistake made by a drunk socialist at a press conference. The memorial to the murded Jews of Europe is quite a chilling abstract, subjective construction. And he-who-must-not-be-named pertinently unacknowledged by a car park. Excellent city one of my favourites but it dosen`t half tear your emotions out of your skin. Quite poignant. Ich bin ein Berliner.</P><hr size='1'><H2>The Polish struggle</H2><H3>2007-02-15</H3><P>A midight train to Krakow and a very murkey, grey day.  As we don`t plan to spend much time here we lock up our bags and look into what can be done in this part of the world.  The first issue, they have changed the currency.  Just when i was coming to terms with the Euro they start using the Zolty......damn them!!  The second isue, another European language I don`t speak (although i becoming very good at a vacant experssion).  I have also discovered that the best way to deal with the language barrier is to stand at the border and shout.  Of course they understand, I`m British!!
</P><P>
</P><P>So we hopped on a train to complete our Jewish education at Auschwitz.  A harrowing history in that place and if I had stayed any longer I may have lost all faith in humanity.  Words cannot descibe the feeling of standing in a gas camber where 2000 people were killed at a time and then had their hair and gold teeth stripped before being burnt.  Only one thing could be done.  We found a bar, got sensibly drunk and discussed the inherent evil of Nazism.
</P><P>
</P><P>Time to get a train to Prague (I hear they have some lovely bars and perhaps we can join a British stag party) and so another night was spent on a sleeper tain with the rumble of the tracks lulling us into a deep sleep.
</P><P>
</P><P>As an aside, as soon as I find a computer that will do what I want it to I will upload more photos.  Promise.</P><hr size='1'><H2>Czeck me out!</H2><H3>2007-02-16 to 2007-02-17</H3><P>Well Prague. It`s a lovely city all in all. They change the guards here like they do in London but they have a band at the window playing a not very honest version of the Tunderbird`s theme tune. Also it is always christmas here and never winter - you can buy (and i did) mulled wine all year round and the weather was better than expected (although snow would have been fun). In a word: Quaint. Now this part of Boheimia is also famous for its Beer. And as travellers of the highest caliber we wish to emmerse ourselves in every culture. So having picked up a yank and a ... (i`ve no idea how to describe someone from Canada), we proceeded to get drunk and put the world to rights (again). And so concludes Prague - I should like to return one day and visit the museum of medival tortue instruments but first to Vienna.</P><hr size='1'><H2>Oh Vienna...........(it means nothing to me!)</H2><H3>2007-02-17 to 2007-02-18</H3><P>Never enter Vienna without a clear plan of where you are going and how to get there.  They don`t have the usual abundance of English speakers at the train stations trying to flog you hostels and so the leg work has to be done yourself (and can be one of the most de-motivating experiences of your life). 
</P><P>
</P><P>Having found a hostel and experienced the tram (never really figured out how to pay so I presume public transport in Austria is free!!) we decided to head out for a beer.  Nothing to severe as we have to go to church tomorrow and it will certainly be nice to wake up without a hangover. 
</P><P>
</P><P>An early start and off to church at the Hofburg palace.  The service is in the Hofmusikkapelle and is conducted in German and Latin (no hope for me there then).  Off to have a coffee and then we decide to improve our Austrian history at the Wein Muzeum (no mention of the world wars, which was odd). 
</P><P>
</P><P>As it was a beautiful winters day we decided to walk along the park to the cemetary where Alumni such as Beethoven, Shubert, Mozart and Hayden are buried.  Having got a cheap map from the station upon arrival we decided to believe the scale.  A MISTAKE.  Due to this we ended up in the middle of a park, miles away from any means of transport and so the only thing to do was carry on (it wouldn`t be right, admitting defeat in Austria).  22 Km walk later and another free train ride we were back at our hostel planning to head to Munich. 
</P><P>
</P><P>Vienna, a beautiful city and a good place to retire too.  My soul feels thoroughly cleansed.</P><hr size='1'><H2>Munich, beer and German sausage.</H2><H3>2007-02-19 to 2007-02-21</H3><P>Well having been in the most horrific motorbike crash of my life so far this morning i have decided to sit down for a while in the Goa shade to fill you guys in a bit. Let`s start in Munich. There`s not a lot to say about this city, being the beer capital of the world it speaks for itself. Having arrived at about 6 am, we made our way quite sleep deprived to our hostel, buzzing from gallons of coffee at about 10. "i`m sorry but you wont be able to cheak in untill 2:30," said a hard to place girl behind the counter: hard to place because she effortlessly skipped between languages producing flawless accents in each as a menagerie of wieried travellers pilled into the hostel. Later she will become Liz. "But please go through to the bar and help yourself to tea and coffee from the breakfast buffet then have a shower if you wish - just up stairs on the right." Relief. "Alright chaps," a voice jumped in our path as we entered the bar. Oli - i last saw him looking quite worse for ware late at night on a street corner in Amsterdam. I too was a little over the hill that night and despite an excellent evening in the dutch capital neither of us thought to exchange detail and so it was a delight to be startled by him. Revived by a good english accent and the promise of a tour of the Munich`s famous beer halls we followed Oli to the Hofbräuhaus where, with over flowing steins we merrily - very merrily - spent the day watching be-lederhosen-ed Bavarians dancing to fiddles whilst eating pretzel and wurst. 
</P><P>
</P><P>Back at the hostel, after a nap, i found Dion in the bar drinking Long Island ice teas with Oli and Glen (Kiwi whom we drank with in Paris and who also made a cameo at Auschwitz). One needs to say little else about that day. 
</P><P>
</P><P>I awoke the next day with an enthusiastic Oli at the end of my bed encouraging me to start the day. The plan was to visit some Bavarian Schloss in the mountains and sap up a bit of culture to prize us from our hagovers. We were however diverted from this pursuit by the hostel staff informing us that Shrove Tuesday  provided the steel-livered Muncheners another excuse to drink all day. The city was closed to traffic and the streets were full of costumes, loud music and confetti. After a couple of medicinal ales and a morning streatch to YMCA we started to feel decidedly underdressed and so returned to the hostel to doll ouselves up a bit. Having enquired at reception where in Munich one would find the best place to get face paint, we found to our surprise that our hosts had preempted us and had the paints there waiting. So being led behind the counter we were kitted out with colourful faces by the multi-talented Liz. Soon after two clowns, two monks a suspiciously masculine girl, a truly demonic Dion and a host of other revellers were battling through the now impossibly, tightly packed streets of Munich. 
</P><P>
</P><P>The rest of the day is sketchy. There was a table, people dancing on the table, then a broken table, on which sat a lot of people wearing surprissed expressions. A lot of singing.  A lot of dancing. A lot of drinking with Liz and a Mancunian called Dave. An Hurculean scrum for a toilet. "New York, New York." A dance - home, a dance on the bar. smugged make up and a rousing recantation of 99 luftballons on the bar finished off with a toast to excellent  drinking companions for shrove Tuesday in Munich. 
</P><P>
</P><P>We joined a free walking tour the next day. I remember little. A farewell drink with Oli then a night train to Sicily and Bertie.</P><hr size='1'><H2>Messy in Messina</H2><H3>2007-02-22 to 2007-02-24</H3><P>If you speak to any Sicilian, the most boring city on the island is Messina.  Undeterred and there already we decided to see the sites.  The problem of travelling without a mobile phone is that if you wish to meet up with someone you have to rely on the internet (not particularly useful for an immediate response) and payphones (I wasn’t sure they even still existed), but with a mixture of luck and good planning we met up with Bertie and the fun could begin.
</P><P>
</P><P>Alex, Bertie’s brother, also appeared in town and we headed out for a couple of drinks and some food.  Bertie teaches the Sicilians the mother tongue and so we headed out to central Messina without our guide to check out the sites.  Messina has the tallest astronomical clock in Europe, a figurine on top of a radio mast in the harbour………………….and lots of cafes (good coffee!!)
</P><P>
</P><P>That night we decided to do a pub crawl of Messina’s bars.  We then needed something else to do and so after spending a lot of time in the final bar we headed back to Bertie’s flat, went skinny dipping (not hugely recommended in February) and then danced the night away.
</P><P>
</P><P>A splendid time was had by all, much due to Bertie’s hospitality.  If you ever plan to go to Sicily, why not check out Messina.  We can turn it into a tourist hotspot yet.
</P><P>
</P><P>As an aside I will never again hear bad things said about Italian engineering.  They devised a way to load trains onto a ferry.  No need to disembark one side only to get onto another train on the other side.  Almost magical!!</P><hr size='1'><H2>All roads lead to Rome at some point.</H2><H3>2007-02-24 to 2007-02-26</H3><P>Well i had composed a beautiful essay detailing why i find Rome one of the most disappointing cities in Italy but i was advised by my optimistic companion that we are supposed to be having fun so let me tell you about our fun in Rome. 
</P><P>
</P><P>Exhasted from the train from Sicily i found the route to our hostel quite a hassel due mainly to the incomprehensible Roman bus network. But having arrived we were enthusiastically welcomed by a group of drunk Romanians. The next day we decided to take in the sites and having walked past the queue for i Vaticani Musei e S. Pietro we ambled around the Pantheon and the Trevi justling with tourists and snapping the appropriate photos before heading through the Forum Romani to the once great Colosseum. Roman ruins have been very well ruined so these days little remains but great voids where greater bulidings once stood. the Colosseum however is still quite extrodinary.  Having taken our fill of the ancient sights we wondered up to the Spanish steps to complete  our circuit of the torist tit-bits. We forced our way through the Americans back to S. Pietro and (...queue...queue...) what an enormous church and what an enormous climb to the top of the dome. Having read some latin and noted a Michelangelo we dinned in front of the Pantheon before returnong to the hostel and joining the Romanians in their merry-making.
</P><P>
</P><P>The following morning we strolled back to the Musei Vaticani or should i say past the museum - about 1km past - to join the back of the entrance queue. We were swept through the museum by a rapid current of American and Japaneese flash photography but  settled a while in the Sistine chapel with its contingent of Americans, militant security guards and a lovely ceiling. We finished our stay in the eternal city by getting an afternoon train to Florence.</P><hr size='1'><H2>Firenze (not the Harry Potter character)</H2><H3>2007-02-26 to 2007-02-27</H3><P>Arrived in Florence after dark to see il Domo beautifully lit up against the star studded sky, with Venus hovering above the Western horizon (I had a feeling I would like this place).
</P><P>
</P><P>In keeping with tradition we felt lubrication was necessary before undertaking a night tour of the city and so a pint later we were taking in the wonderful architecture and sculpture in the city.  Eventually we fortified a position on a bridge opposite the Ponte Vechio (means old bridge – I wonder what it was called when it was new?) and merrily chatted as the night slipped away.
</P><P>
</P><P>It was like we have entered a different country.  Every other person in Florence is an American.  Not a problem as such, but their continually enthusiasm about how everything is awesome does become draining (we pretended to be German – a reasonably successful tactic).
</P><P>
</P><P>It was finally time to go and see the last major site on our European list.  A sculpture of perfect human form that is apparently the only piece of sculpture anyone needs to see (all other sculptures will be no more than a disappointment).  In my humble opinion however, Michelangelo gave his sculpture of David slightly big hands…………but who am I to question a master.
</P><P>
</P><P>As Florence is quite a small city and we felt we had been under using our legs we decided to take on the hill to the Bronze copy of David.  Looks pretty much the same, but in green and he is a little thinner (they clearly don’t feed the copies very well), but the view from the hill was worth the walk.  It was a beautiful day in Florence and so a perfect opportunity to try some of the famous ice cream.</P><hr size='1'><H2>The French Riviera</H2><H3>2007-02-28 to 2007-03-01</H3><P>We got off the train from Florence in Monaco expecting to spend the day here however having discovered that there was nowhere to leave our bags at the station - a note for all you would be travellers - we stepped back on the train and stepped off again in Nice. Dropping our bags at our hotel - yes, hotel - we lunched on the sea front on the old favourite of baguette, cheese and ham before returning to Monaco with a little less luggage. Having spent a while window shoppinh for luxury yachts we raced around the Monte Carlo grand prix circuit - alas, on foot - and popped into the casino en route and managed to stay my hand from the roulette table. Looking for more amusement we ascended the hill and stopped a while outside the royal palace and then headed back to Nice. On the beech in Nice the waters looked warma and inviting however having jumped in i found that i had been decieved and that the Mad can be cold in February. So i warmed myself up again with a couple of beers then headed back to the hotel, picking up a pizza along the way to catch up on my favourite French soap - La plus belle vie - and the auditions stages of Nouvelle Star (French pop idol). After an early night we were forced out of bed to get the 8.33 from Nice to Marseille where we lunched at the airport before flying back to London.</P><hr size='1'><H2>The gateway to India</H2><H3>2007-03-06 to 2007-03-09</H3><P>After a cramped long flight, all you really want is a cold shower and a chance to catch up on some lost sleep.  Welcome to Mumbai.  It`s the middle of the day (only 40 degrees) and you have no idea where you are or how to get to your hostel.  Unfortuantely that also seems true for the taxi drivers.  
</P><P>
</P><P>The roads have few street names and the drivers are all manically insane, but with the help of a few locals we manage to find our hostel and prepare ourselves for our Mumbai experience.
</P><P>
</P><P>It doesn`t seem too busy, but then we discover that we are infact 30 minutes by train from the tourist centre.  A sense of dread appeared as we imagined what an Indian train might be like, but it was fairly empty with ceiling fans (standing room only) but a very efficient means of transport.
</P><P>
</P><P>To cross the raod in Mumbai is to take your life into your own hands, but at any crossing point eventually the numbers become large enough for the cars to have to stop or cause a massacre.  The sights of Mumbai are not numerous and the food and drink is "expensive" but we had some fun experiences.  Being white gets you stared at in Mumbai, being outlandishly tall gets people not looking away when you catch their eye and walking alongside you for miles just to get a comparison.  They are all friendly about it and you can have some entertaining conversations in broken English with them as you walk.
</P><P>
</P><P>The rickshaw.  A most noble means of transportation and several were used in our hunt for the consulate of Vietnam.  There isn`t one (and if there is i don`t want to hear about it.  I enjoy my ignorance), but at least we managed to accost a hospital porter to aid us in our search.  he didn`t even want a tip.......most unusual!!!
</P><P>
</P><P>To avid the general pandemonium of the city we also took some time to explore the wonders of elephante island (the British removed the statue of the elephant that gave the island its name, but strangely didn`t put it in the British museum!?!).  Lots of caves, monkeys and cows.  It was nice to be able to sit somewhere and not have someone try to sell you a giant inflatable balloon or magnets.
</P><P>
</P><P>The train home showed Indian trains to be exactly what you would expect.  The war cries as you entered a station from people about to board, the pushing, holding on for dear life and then off goes the train again.  I felt like a battery farmed chicken, but got to talk to lots of Indians about cricket (they rarely talk about anything else).
</P><P>
</P><P>Mumbai.....we probably spent too long there given what it had to offer, but certainly an experince i will remember and even, most of the time, enjoyed.
</P><P>
</P><P>I will put photos up at some point, but this computer and my camera don`t seem to get on.......i`ll get them to talk it out over lunch.</P><hr size='1'><H2>Goa I: Anjuna.</H2><H3>2007-03-10 to 2007-03-16</H3><P>We arrived in Goa early in the morning where we were ushered off the train by a obstreperous Italian/Goan Lady who insisted that we should share a taxi to Anjuna with her and a South African/Goan Lady ... and their delightful children. 
</P><P>
</P><P>And so we arrived at our accomodation tired, hot and exceptionaly infanticidal. The place however was more than we could have hoped for. Anjuna Palms guest house is composed of a hamlet of five rooms in the back garden of a family house. The family - Dena, Felix and Caleb - went out of their way to ensure that we had everything we could want. We were even cooked a Goan shell curry for breakfast one morning to our delight. 
</P><P>
</P><P>So having forgotten the stress and hectic atmosphere of the city we all too easily relaxed into the Goan way of life. 
</P><P>
</P><P>Anjuna has taken its toll on time too. The chilled out vibe seems to have retarded temporal progression so that nothing seems to have changed since the coming of the Hippies in the late 60s. One wonders down the street past long, grey haired, leathery, golden brown, old flower children driving around topless on 125cc Enfields. It was at this point that we decided to get a bike. Dena (our hostess) made a quick phone call and within seconds we were the proud owners of a fierce motorbike. We took it for a spin...
</P><P>
</P><P>It is hard to say for how many hours or days we had lain in the dust and bubbling tarmac after the crash but thirteen vulturs were circuling our blooded location and 12 rabid dogs were sparring nearby for the possession of our mortal remains. The road was empty and our location was unkown to me. We could have travelled for hundreds of miles on the bike before we were vanquished. I suspected that i had broken every bone in my entire body with the exception of a femur, a tibia and my mallei, incudes and stapedes, though i was getting most pain from my wrist and foot. I had to make a run for it. Collecting together as much of my spilt blood as i could i hoisted myself onto my one semi-intact limb and throwing a groaning Dion over one shoulder and the mangled motorcycle over the other i started the slow and agonising treck back to our first aid kit. For days and days the baking sun oppressed and frustrated this lonely journey but for days and days i pressed forward the best i could untill once more i collapsed in the dust and the light receeded from my eyes. The dreams and deliria that go through ones head in such a state are unutterable but from them once again i awoke. This time i found myself hanging from a resurected Dion and in sight of home. The Heroic traveller had come to during my unconciousness and dragged our bloody corpses back to Anjuna. Whereat we used half a first aid kit to patch ourselves back together. 
</P><P>
</P><P>There is a bar in Anjuna called the Sea Queen which shows two (pirated) films nightly in the garden while you eat, drink and be merry. This is were, that night, we met Bryan, a Canadian, who will now take up the narrative, since he was attentive and was, "always listening carefully for a conversation in English. Which is how I started meeting Brits (Brits speaking English, shocking!), and eventually a couple of guys named Dionne [sic.](or James according to every piece of ID he has on him) and Duane. Now I don`t know whether it was because these guys were former Manchester-ites, whether they had just survived a `minor` scooter accident that day (only to survive another one the following day), or because we watched all of `Love Actually` together (huge Hugh Grant fans, those guys), whatever it was, we seemed to put up with each other. We spent the next few days burning on the beach then the two of them crashing the scooter in the evening before meeting up for a movie during dinner. It was a lot of fun, especially since they were the ones showing up every night with new cuts, limps, and bruises, it seemed we always had something to talk about. Final night in Goa, we`re doing more of the same, sans scooter crashing, when we meet a couple of Swedish girls who were all types of Swedish, fitting almost every stereotype I knew, who apparently had been background bikini beach blondes (alliteration? No....onomatopoeia? No.....it is one of those words you learn in English Lit. classes.....blame the education system) in a Bollywood film in Mumbai. We go out for drinks with them. Once pass formalities, names, where you`re from, the third subject was (cover the ears Grandma) sex. Now I`m looking down at the table and I count one drink, and I barely touched it. Maybe I have limited experience in this but usually we`re a bit short of drinks for sex talk and usually the guy has to do a long, drawn out mind-game before a girl even utters the word. I think even the Brits were a little surprised......Why didn`t I visit Sweden? After getting fairly inebriated until well passed 3 in the morning, I stumbled home and pretty much blinked before being woken up by a pounding on the door by my taxi driver".

But in the void left by his absense the love generation was formed...</P><hr size='1'><H2>The fondest memories to cling on to are the hardest ones to keep.</H2><H3>2007-03-17 to 2007-03-22</H3><P>It was Demelza`a birthday. Demelza is from Brighton and was staying across the garden from us. Lucas (Aussie) and Anti (Fin) live next door to us (this is the poor man`s side of the garden.) We had been to the beach a couple of times with Lucas and Anti and had exchanged pleasantries, chatted about cricket and had even been to see Pulp Fiction ... so we got on quit well. As i said it was Demelza`s birthday. It is hard to explain how intense brief inter-traveler friendships can be. The closest parallel would probably be fresher`s week when you find yourself friends with everyone (apologies for those who have never been to university - perhaps it would be like your first week at work: I don`t know). So... it was Demelza`s birthday and so everyone was the best of friends. We went out to Ingo`s Saturday night market - it`s a hippy affair. Like the Wednesday Flea market only at night, on a Saturday and with beer and live music (sitars; bongos; didgeridoos - you get the set up!). The food is particularly good here too! We drank, laughed, larked while watching the array of musical talent, hypnotists and Japaneses fire dancers. After the live entertainment we meandered through the stalls to the dance floor (centered round a tree - as most things are). Here we strutted our stuff before the latest Goan trance before tumbling back into our garden and divulging in turn our life stories and singing "Feel the Love Generation". We had booked three night at the Anjuna Palms guest house and left a week later than our first extension. It`s hard to say how we spent the time because really we didn`t do that much. We got up late. Went to Munchies (next door) for breakfast. Read. Went to the beach. Had dinner. Watched a film (or two) at the Sea Queen. Watched the cricket at Eatopia. Fell into bed about 3am. It was because of this well structured nothingness that one night we decided do something: to have a beach party. Our beach bar was called Lilliput. On the Monday evening (I couldn`t tell you which Monday but the flyer had informed me that it was a Monday) there was a show case of local musical talent at Lilliput (local as in Americans, Canadians, Australians etc.) There were fire works on the beach (literally), and an auditorium on the sand. The bands were excellent and when they had finished i heard cries for more. We went into the bar where Dion very graciously and with the best of intentions lost a game of pool to an angry Irishman who appeared slightly unhinged while i chatted away in my own form of perfect German to a lady from Salzburg. Oh how we danced that night. I`m not sure who first suggested the skinny dipping but there really is no feeling like floating in a warm sea in the dark, naked, under the stars (Demelza abstained - as girls will). If you lie on the beach looking at the stars you can pretend that you are hanging from the beach and that it would be possible to fall onto the stars below (Henry - I`ve been told that you are a champion of this game) and so we wiled away a couple more hours in this fashion. You need an astro-physicist to really get the most out of this game - luckily we had one. I don`t remember getting to bed - probably on account of the feni (the local firewater) - but a truly successful party. One thing i did discover in Anjuna: a wonderful way to cope with a hangover is to spend the day floating in a warm sea. There is little more to say. Everyday was as excellent as the one before though i couldn`t tell you what i did. And it took a very long time to pluck up the motivation to leave. On Thursday the 22nd of March we finally managed to move three hours down the coast to Palolem. Damelza came with us.</P><hr size='1'><H2>Goa`way</H2><H3>2007-03-22 to 2007-03-27</H3><P>After managing to escape Anjuna and its rustic hippie charm (with a lot of help from Demelza), we arrived on the sun-drenched, postcard picture beaches of Palolem.  It has everything a holiday maker could want for a winter retreat to the sun.  Idyllic beaches, a shore line covered with cheap bars and restaurants and quirky accommodation as far as the eye could see.  This does however bring an unwholesome variety of traveller to the area.  Affectionately named 10 dayers by my esteemed travelling companion, they can be seen from sunrise (I could have seen them, but its a very detrimental time of day to be up) to sunset basking like giant reptiles in the baking sun.  After disappearing for a few joyous hours (I can but assume they are busy applying aftersun) they reappear, pinker than the day before and ready to sample the finest food and cocktails that Goa has to offer.
</P><P>
</P><P>Palolem has one late night bar and this is where the Brits file in, already staggering in and out of the sea, to finish their nights off with some overly strong rum and cokes and, if it tickles their fancy, a fight.  Brits abroad hey!
</P><P>
</P><P>They are of course a minority and the people you meet in south Goa are incredibly friendly.  The staff in the restaurants speak perfect English and are always eager to help.  The shop owners hassle you for a few less hours than on the beach in Anjuna and if you want nothing more than to lie in the sun and swim in a warm sea then it is perfect.
</P><P>
</P><P>Being restless types however, we decided to have an explore.  There is one main road behind the beach and a small market.  A good way to kill an hour or two and plenty of nice  bars (even an English pub!!!!!!!).  The evenings were always entertaining with one or more of the bars having live music, beach fires and happy hours and we could often be found in the early hours of the morning with Demelza and our new chum Laura, lying on the sand, gazing at the stars and putting the world to rights.
</P><P>
</P><P>The problem with Goa is that it is incredibly easy to get used to doing absolutely nothing but sit on the beach and so planning your escape takes a concerted effort.  It was decided the best way out would be a sleeper coach from Chaudi to Bangalore (anything to avoid going anywhere near Mumbai!).  This meant 15 hours sharing a bed the size of a small single (designed for people of a shorter stature) with a fellow traveller.  I was lucky, I got Demelza, Duane had to make do with a thoroughly nice Indian.
</P><P>
</P><P>A restless night of being launched into the air after every bump followed until we arrived safe, if a little sore into Bangalore.  How on earth are we going to get to Delhi.</P><hr size='1'><H2>Cheers Lee.</H2><H3>2007-03-29 to 2007-04-01</H3><P>The number of times i`ve had to rewrite these Diary entries because computers find it terribly amusing to delete them just as they are about to be saved will diving me to murder. My apologies to the computer technician i just shouted at if you happen to be reading this. As i was saying before the computer devoured my words. We got the night bus from Palolem to Bangalore and having packed Demelza off to an Ashram with a suspected neo-Nazi, Dion and i made our way to Cubbon Park and wasted away the afternoon playing chess. After a refreshing pomegranate juice and half a game of Top Trumps we bumped into Lee Parnel a friend from my uni days at Bath, who now happened to be in Bangalore working for Reuters. It is quite impossible to express the feelings roused as one stumbles back into reality after spending weeks nomadically. We watched TV. Since we were in India we ordered an English take-away and were served the most delightful food mine and Dion`s combined imagination was incapable of imagining. After dinner and a good, warm, spider / cockroach free shower we headed into Bangalore to experience the India high life. The 13th floor bar is a bar aptly named because of its location on the 13th floor of a shopping mall. Sitting on the roof terrace over looking the vast sprawling city we rubbed shoulders with the creme de la creme of South India`s yuppie classes, most of who, i`m sure, thought we could have showered a bit more. The next day we got up late (well those who didn`t have to be at work at 9 got up late) and watched more TV. Then we took a tuc-tuc to Reuters and were treated to lunch at the 5* Leela Palace Hotel (where they even air-condition the gardens and put fresh rose petals in the fountains daily).  We wasted the rest of the day wondering around the Botanical Garden before catching the 42 hour train to Delhi. For the next two days Dion read Catch 22 and Moby Dick and i read Crime and Punishment.</P><hr size='1'><H2>There`s nothing like a capital</H2><H3>2007-04-01 to 2007-04-02</H3><P>Well, we have made it to the north.  After a train journey that promise to be so much worse than it turned out, we were dropped in the bustling metropolis that is Delhi.  [It`s interesting, why would I want a rickshaw from one guy when he saw me turn down one of his competitors a few seconds before.  They are an optimistic bunch.]  We found our hotel (not actually on the road they claimed it to be on, but close enough), had a wonderful shower and set out to see what Delhi has to offer.  First stop - the Red Fort.  It certainly is red and contains some very impressive architecture, but it`s just a fort.  So back out into the blistering heat and down some crowded, but very interesting market streets.  We were looking for food, but stumbled across instead the Jama Masjid Mosque (the largest mosque in India).  We were refused admission due to our attire, but completed a circuit of the mosque, thwarted an eager young pickpocket and headed into a cafe for a currey.
</P><P>
</P><P>A walk down the Meena Bazaar later, as the faithful were being called to pray, made us feel walking back to the hotel may be a nice way to see some of old Delhi.  Once again we were a touch overambitious concerning how far we could realistically walk and so jumped in a rickshaw and headed to the main bazaar.
</P><P>
</P><P>Local elections are begin held in Delhi in the not too distant future and so politicians are on the campaign trail.  Unbeknown to us, we had been marked with the symbol of one of the political parties at the Red Fort and were only saved the embarrassment of having to explain out political persuasion by some crafty work by Stephen.  Stephen, an ex-pat, had  been living in India for years and so was wise to the situation in Delhi.  He suggested to us that we leave politics to the residents of Delhi, have a drink or two and watch the cricket.
</P><P>
</P><P>Another day and yet more sun.  I`m beginning to miss the rain (that`s the Manc in me talking).  We set off early to sort a train to the north and deal with the visa issue.  It seems you cannot book a train from Delhi without your passport and so we turned for help to the internet and have found an alternative method of visa application.  Success, and so with the rest of the day to spend in Delhi, we turn to the guidebook for advice and spend some time ambling around some of Delhi`s many Bazaars.</P><hr size='1'><H2>Retreat in the mountains</H2><H3>2007-04-03 to 2007-04-04</H3><P>What with the heat, dust and general commotion of cities having surrounded us ever since we tore ourselves away from Goa; we decided to head to the hills for some much needed relaxation and tranquility.  Rishikesh seem like the ideal location (what with every well travelled hippie we met advising us in that general direction) and so off we went to the Ashram ridden hills.  The scenery was spectacular to say the least and when we arrived, just after sunrise, it was cold (20 degrees); if only i had brought my jumper with me.  This brief return to what a summer should be like didn`t last long though, as we headed off into the hills, badly equiped and lacking a sensible amount of water.
</P><P>
</P><P>Not to make the parents panic, we of course retreated back to town and had a dip in the Gangees (its not polluted this high up) and sat having a pleasant lunch listening to the religious ringing of bells.  The day progressed and we perused the local markets for anything we could possibly want.  Feeling it dangerous to buy anymore jewels for fear of falling into hippydom we decided it was best to escape the sun and catch up on some mythical characters.
</P><P>
</P><P>Come sunset the Ashram begin a religious light display and chant to the ringing of bells.  A very mystical experience with the sun disappearing behins the mountains turning the Gangees and eerie shade of Orange.  It then lead ti a cool night and so, after so long spent on trains, it was possible to get a good night sleep.
</P><P>
</P><P>More chanting at sunrise (do these people sleep?) and so up early when it`s cool.  After a hearty breakfast it was time for a bus ride to Saharanpur.  Two hours of being mostly on the wrong side of the road (i miss the trains).
</P><P>
</P><P>Saharanpur doesn`t appear in the guidebook and so, safe to say, we were the only tourists in the state (probably).  Incredibly busy and one of the most confusing train stations in the whole of the world, but eventually we find our train and head East towards Varanassi.</P><hr size='1'><H2>Varanasi: Holy Cow!</H2><H3>2007-04-05 to 2007-04-07</H3><P>The tuc-tuc got us as far as it could but before too long the driver could go no further. The allyways of Varanasi are a tight compact network of ancient cobbles full of ancient charm that time dare not traverse. The city claims to be the oldest continually used settlement in the world and the multiple layers of dust and dirt testify well to this. As our driver retreated to the safty of the more recently developed byways we entered the maze that at times reminded me of the Laberynthine goblin city and at time the worst recesses of the Arndale centre. Wondering cows would bloke our parth forcing us to persue a different course where colourful fruit peddlers would retard our passage vending their fly-ridden morsels. To my right a painted yogi sat chanting his mantras while to my left a small child earnestly beckoned me to look in his shop "looking is free", he added. As we entered our room however before us was a panoramic expanse of sand and sky while in the fore ground the mighty Ganges slowly and ominously rolled along. We were staying in the turret of a castle built in the 16th centry by the Maharana of Udaipur and the room was perfect. It was the world of Scheherazade`s 1001 nights combined with the baking heat of the Sahara. We wondered up the Ghats that line the river bank watching devout Hindus washing away their mortal sins in Ganga that holiest of rivers as it flowed though Shiva`s city. We had arranged to meet Damelza so i got on the phone. " Where are you?". " I`m standing in an alyway next to a cow", came the crackling reply down the line. "We must be close then", said I, "for i`m in an alyway next to a cow too!". Having met our macabre cruiosity led us to the burning Ghat where the most fortunate Hindus are publicaly cremated on pyres of Sandlewood before having their ashes swept into the stream. The fires burn 24 hours a day consuming in this period 300 corpses. Only the most pure bodies, that have never known the company of a woman - children and gurus - may be interred in the waters whole. The final act of the ceremony is to smash the skulls of the deceased allowing the pure soul exit from the mortal realm. After this we sat down to drink a Pepsi and reflect on Life and Death. After a brief repose we were led back into the alyways by a guy called Sanjay to a Golden temple were i was begarlened with lotus flowers and had ash spread over my forehead as i lay prostrate with my head on a Linga for potency in later life. Varanesi is certainly a city of contrasts and a voyeur`s paradise.</P><hr size='1'><H2>Preparing for the worst</H2><H3>2007-04-08 to 2007-04-09</H3><P>Everyone that we have met in India, without fail, has said that if you are not bothered about going to see the Taj Mahal then stay out of Agra, it`s a dive.  Well being interested in the finer points of architecture (and it`s always nice to say you`ve been somewhere famous), myself, Duane and Demelza arrived in Arga and we picked up by an overfriendly rickshaw driver who didn`t seem that keen on watching the road, not with all this excitment going on behind him.  After settling into our standard hotel room (3 in a bed, it`s the cheap way to do things!) we headed off to the Agra fort. 
</P><P>
</P><P>We decided to get a guide as the bloke was incredibly enthusiastic and actually really good fun to be around.  We were told of the history of the fort; lots of Marharaja with complicated names and lots of illegitimate wives.  With views over the river to the Taj Mahal, we decided it was high time that we headed off to see the most famous piece of Indian architecture and, apparently, one of the seven wonders of the mordern world. 
</P><P>
</P><P>Staggeringly beautiful, perfectly symmetrical and surrounded by tourists - it didn`t disappoint.  Had many an Indian family ask me to have their photo taken with their children and really suprised an American couple when I answered their question in perfect English (yes, some people outside America speak English too!).
</P><P>
</P><P>Off to a nearby rooftop for a drink and to gaze at the Taj Mahal as the sunset.  No sunset was seen; however, as clouds came rolling in and we were treated to a fierce electrical storm with the lightning illuminating all things for miles.  Time to find a bar, watch England lose at the cricket and put the world to rights.
</P><P>
</P><P>Next day and early start and a second class train journey to Delhi, so after a shower, we headed off to the station.  A suprisingly enjoyable train journey mixing with the locals and talking about their passion - cricket.
</P><P>
</P><P>We don`t have long in Delhi as we have plans to get a night train to Udaipur and so after spending some time on our favourite street (the Main Bazaar) we catch our tain and get some well deserved shut-eye.  The moral to this story is that all the people we met were wrong, I wouldn`t go back to Agra, but I am delighted to have seen it.</P><hr size='1'><H2>Udaipur: The Maharana and Octopussy.</H2><H3>2007-04-10 to 2007-04-13</H3><P>As the sun rose over lake Pochala we arrived in Udaipur. The Maharanas of Mewar claim to have been the longest unbroken dynasty in the world. Descended from the sun the Maharanas have held the throne for 76 generation and the palaces of Udaipur do much to suggest this long and proud history. A history that was only ended 35 years ago when Indra Ghandi stripped the Idian princes of the titles and privileges. The star in the cities crown is the famous lake palace that majestically floats in the middle of Pochala. There is little to do but relax and enjoy the wonderful vistas. We met Damelza (again) shortly after we arrived and a hole host of other nationalities staying in the most charming Lal Ghat guest house - and old house sitting on the edge of the lake. Most days we would either sit in the courtyard  or on the balconies bettering ourselves through reading or debate. The city palace was wortha trip though so we rallied a posse of travellers and picking up a very enthusiastic guide we wondered around the history of the city. Now the other reason to come to Udaipur is, of course, that it was in this city that Rodger Moore brought James Bond and Octopusssy together. If you were unaware of this before you arrived you would not be able to remain so for long. Udaipur is the only place in the world that i`m aware of where you can walk into any bar at any time, rquest to watch Octopussy and the staff will be more than more than happy to oblige.Every rooftop retaurant and bar nightly shows the film so you can sit and keep one eye on the movie and one eye on the locations at which it was filmed. We watched it twice. Of course the Maharana had and has (he now lives in a wing of the city palace off the revenue from his other palaces whih have all become 5* hotels) a splendid collection of vintage European and American cars. And of course his Rolls Royce phantom II had a cameo in the Bond film. So we paid our Rs 100 and two envious boys were led around the garages. The final palace to visit in Udaipur is the Monsoon palace. Perched on top of a hill it hangs over the city and offers the most incredible views of the surrounding area. Inspired by 007, we raced up the winding mountain pass, girls vs boys in two struggling tuc-tucs. The boys won, naturally, after the girl`s steed overheated and they had wasted their water throwing it over the boys in a moment of competative arrogance. But at the top all jibes were silenced by the majesty of the setting sun. built by a line of princes that claim the sun as their ancestor the monsoon palace resembled a temple to the setting sun in which the light seemed to be honoured and commanded the utmost respect and tranquillity. The jorney home was quiet and peaceful. We stayed in Udaipur longer than we anticipated and we would not have left for much longer if our flight to Hanoi did not loom on the horizon. The city and company was perfect.</P><hr size='1'><H2>A quick dip into the capital of Rajasthan</H2><H3>2007-04-14 to 2007-04-15</H3><P>Having stayed longer than expected in Udaipur we were left a morning to tackle the overwhelming Pink city.  An early wake up call from the train conductor at 7 am plunged us both into foul moods and so we commandeered a rickshaw driver and went for a leisurely breakfast.  With our mood much improved by sandwiches and the sweet taste of chi we decided to take on the sights of Jaipur and headed off to Janta Mantra, the astronomical observatory of Jaipur.  Feeling quite in my element we set about learning how the massive sundials worked, how this could be used to create a birthchart and how to find the latitude and longitude of Jaipur.  I WANT ONE!!!!!
</P><P>
</P><P>Our trusty ricshaw driver was waiting outside and whisked us off to the Amber fort which afforded us spectacular views of the ancient city of Amber and of the 3 beautifully decorated palaces off the Maharaja.  Duane was even able to confront his fears and sit down beside a snake charmer - the snake wasn`t having any of it and barely managed to rear up.
</P><P>
</P><P>With thoughts of our flight the following day lingering in our mind, we decided to attempt to get to Dehi that day.  All aboard the bus at 13:30 and so began our long and arduous journey to Delhi.  Time spent on the main road was pleasant enough, but buses are very bad at entering major cities and we spent hours negotiating the Delhi traffic.  After being dropped off at some unknown location in Delhi we were unable to locate a rickshaw.  Whenever you actually need one they disappear off the face of the Earth as if to mock you and so we had to get a peddle rickshaw, with all our stuff and mostly uphill.  Poor driver almost had a heartattack - good excersise though!
</P><P>
</P><P>Now it was 11 pm and we found a hotel and a bar and put the frustrating trip behind us.  I am not a violent man, but if someone had given me reason to get annoyed I may have had to dispose of a body.  Fortunately enough any drop in Delhi`s population has nothing to do with me!
</P><P>
</P><P>Check out time was at 12 as so we took the chance to catch up on some lost sleep and then took to wandering the streets of Delhi until it was time to end this Indian experince and head of into SE Asia.
</P><P>
</P><P>Such a diverse and beautiful country.  6 weeks is no-where near long enough to discover all of the treasures that lay hidden within its vast expanse of countryside.  Any climate you would wish to expience or any type of land, India can offer it in a charming and traditional way.  Another country down, Vietnam has a lot to live up to!</P><hr size='1'><H2>A short eulogy by Demelza. Cheers gal.</H2><H3>2007-04-15</H3><P>Good Bye James and Duane.. 
</P><P>Current mood:  touched 
</P><P>
</P><P>[to fully appreciate this know that Damelza only has one leg]
</P><P>
</P><P>..Well today is the last day James Duane and myself will hang out. we have travelled a lot together in a three and it has been great. I must say how supportive both of them have been, they have helped me out in many ways. The first time i was so impressed with thier caring attitudes, it was back in Anjuna and we were all walking along to a beach party. It wasn`t miles and miles away but it was quite a trek in the pitch black. Bless their cottons, with their torch they made sure the path way was lkit the whole way there and back so i didn`t fall. Now this may sound very simple, but to me it meant a great deal - helped me a great deal too. 
</P><P>
</P><P>I would also like to bring to your attention that Duane actually slept on the floor of the train and gave me his bed so i wouldn`t have to travel second class, he also shared a bed with a random Indian dude (so i didn`t have too) on a 16hour bus journey,  (phew!). Very kind indeed. 
</P><P>
</P><P>James has been very supportive friend also, he helped me a great deal in Varanessi, stair city! He carried my back pack for me and is always making sure i am ok, waiting for me helping me out, passing my crutches. James often makes sure i am well and all is ok. 
</P><P>
</P><P>But neither of the lads have ever been over the top with their support, they have just stepped in when i have needed the help, it has been grand. And on top of all of that we have had a really good time together, the three of us work well as a team. Duane and I bicker sometimes, ha ha (strong personalities) but really we know it is in jest, very childlike in ways :o) And James and i have star gazed many a time(has a degree in astronomy which i think is cool), talked about life religion and logic, and he has talked about the moon and the stars ect - we have all ...[editor`s privilage]... together, got drunk, swam in the sea, shared the same bed, visited Taj mahul togehter, watch octopussy, saw bodies being burnt - all od this in three to four weeks -  we have done many great things and i shall miss them both as of today. It has been such a pleasure hanging out with both of them, they are both very ambicious and i believe each of them will be great successful people, they are half way there already.
</P><P>
</P><P> 
</P><P>
</P><P>If you read this James and Duane - THANKS GUYS - really means alot x</P><hr size='1'><H2>Ha Long Bay.</H2><H3>2007-04-18 to 2007-04-20</H3><P>We were woken up early and piled onto a minibus to be wisked off to the coast. We stoped off half way in a car park with the greatest population of Westerners that i had seen in a very long time. When we arrived at the harbour we were hurded onto a boat and seated for lunch. The bay is ruptured by 1,969 natural, limestone monoliths and so is quite a sight for tired eyes. Firstly our boat took us to a system of caves within one of these obelisks. Having spent a timw trying to identify the swooping dragons and young lovers that our guide claimed to see among the stalactites we reborded the boat and spent the afternoon drifting amound the rocks. After sunset and, perhaps more importantly, dinner we spent the evening anchored in a lagoon beneeth the stars, drinking lager and cheep vodka while making merry with our band of fellow adventurers. The next morning came too late for canoeing as we awoke to see the other guests returning from their mornings activity (it was still only 06:30). After breakfast the boat dropped us off on Cat Ba Island where we were lead on a treck. Up through the cliffs we were led and down into a modest jungle before rising again to the top of a mountain. At this point I decided to discuss the pros and cons of shopping at Trago Mills with a girl from Devon. After noon we were taken to our hotel on the island from which we gat a boat to Monkey Island were we swam, canoed and avoided jelly fish while watching other tourists avoiding the monkeys. The evening was spent in Cat Ba town - a sort of poor man`s Blackpool - before hitting the sack and awaiting dawn. The next morning we were picked up from the hotel at taken by boat back to the main land where, after lunch we were driven back to Hanoi.</P><hr size='1'><H2>Sap`s your energy</H2><H3>2007-04-22 to 2007-04-24</H3><P>Following recommendations from friends and fellow travellers alike, we turned our attention to the north of Vietnam and the mountains; and so boarding our train late at night we headed off towards the Chinese border and the town of Sapa.
</P><P>
</P><P>After not much sleep, for a change, we arrived, checked in and headed off to the Sapa market where a whole host of seemingly pointless parafernalia was thrust in our directions.  Fighting off the flash backs of India we had some banter with the locals, were adorned with bracelets (free of charge) and bought some tat - it seemed only fair.
</P><P>
</P><P>Back to the hotel for lunch (I don`t want to alarm you, but a dead dog was seen in the kitchen, prime for cooking) and then we met our guide, Lam, who took us down to Cat Cat Village, the site of a beautiful waterfall.  A swift motorbike ride back (there was no way i was going to drag myself back up that hill) and it was time for dinner.  After a few sociable dinks we headed off to a bar where the local tibal girls were successfully hustling every foreigner that came in at pool.
</P><P>
</P><P>An early start as Lam took us on our 12 km trekk (mostly downhill) through the rice fields of the local tribes.  Terraced farming with an incredible irrigation system took me back to my Geography GCSE.  Stepping stones were a neccessary obsticale to overcome in the flooded fields and as a Frenchman lead the way I, heroically, helped a family in my wake.  Good job the Frenchman was in front as he pointed out a paricularly hazardos point by manfully falling into a ditch.  It was all I could do to suppress my laughter.
</P><P>
</P><P>After making friends with some more locals, who made Duane and I garlands shaped like hearts, we came to the village of Loa Chai, populated by the H`mong people - they are all very small!!!.  We then went to the village of Ta Van (Dzay people) had lunch and were given a speedy return to the hotel in a mini-bus.
</P><P>
</P><P>Sufficiently tried, but well fed, we returned the way we came, back to Loa Cai train station and headed back to Hanoi on the night train, where we were greeted by our friendly hotel staff and given a bed to recuperate in for a couple of hours free of charge!!  Time to head south and see what the rest of this country as to offer.</P><hr size='1'><H2>Hue</H2><H3>2007-04-25 to 2007-04-27</H3><P>Dion, Duane, Freddy and Glen arrived in Hue early in the morning and tired. They took the cheapest hotel that was on offer from the guys that met them at the bus stop and having dropped off their stuff brteakfasted on scrambled eggs and bacon washed down with lashings of iced coffee. They decided to hire bikes for the day and get out of the city and so after a while they were cruising down the streets of the city heading out towards the lush green countryside and the mountains beyond. With the wind in their hair and nothing but adventure in front of them hastle bothered them from no direction. Riding along the Perfume river they pulled up outside a Pagoda that had been recomended to them as on of the oldest ones in the city. They decided that it was a lovely pagoda and set off again. After returning to the city for a lunch (or two, for the German) they headed south towards a monestry. The Zen monks were very welcoming and the boys spoke for hours refining their knowledge of the finer theologies of Buddism and watched the younger monks play and agressive game of football. Tired, yet enlightened Dion and Duane road back to the hotel leaving Freddy talking to the monks and Glen headed out into the hills. That evening they found Thu. "Me love you long time", she called as they wondered wondering about dinner. "lovely gubbley. Happy Hour". Sold. They spent the night and a bottle of Rum in Thu`s "Cafe on Thu Wheels" and never has a single bar maid provided so much entertainment for her punters. Wheather creating a Sweedish birthday cake or playing games involving bottles and biros she entertained the lads while merrily peddling tours of the city. "I shall have to recomend this place to anyone I know comming this way", thought the boys. The next day our four heroes went on a tour of the DMZ. Highlights included Khe Sahn air base and the tunnels at Vin Moc on the north Viet Nam side of the 17th Parallel. At this point your humble narrator is at a loss. Although logically our fantastic four must have done something that evening what this may have been was unfortunately lost to our little history but for continuity assume that were with Thu again (as is more than likely the case anyway). The next day was hot and so a postcard was written to a Mr D. Rusbrige of London, England while the afternon was spent strolling about another palace. This activity led to a lengthy debate about what the term "forbiden city" means literally and in recomending the palace to future adventurers your narrator remembers only the debate and not the palace. Dinner, Beer then an early bus for the quartet to Hoi An the next morning.</P><hr size='1'><H2>A suit too far!</H2><H3>2007-04-28 to 2007-05-01</H3><P>A quick jump down the coast and we find ourselves almost by the seaside on the banks of the Thu Bon river.  Aching and pleased to be off the bus we send Glenn on a fact-finding mission and he discovers a free hotel (it`s a Vietnamese holiday, possibly the Vietnamese new year and so the place is busy) and so we move in and set about discovering the town.
</P><P>
</P><P>We are a ten minute walk from the historic old town of Hoi An and so wander along past the shops selling tailored made suits (there are a lot of these), shoes and tat made out of wood.  To this day i think we should have paid to enter the old town, but being poor travellers and the place being covered in alley ways it didn`t seems necessary.
</P><P>
</P><P>After a delightful dinner, we decide to have a look at some tailors.  A dangerous move, the girls who work there are like vultures.  They give you food, water, are forever producing flattering comments and some of their finest material.  At times like these i wish i had done some textiles at school - what determines a good fabric?  Anyway, before the evening is out Glenn has ordered an all white suit and i have a DJ being made for me.  I`m even told to call the owner of the shop Mum!!
</P><P>
</P><P>Time for some culture and so we go on a tour (i`m begining to get a little sick of these things) to some ancient Hindu ruins that are apparently older than Angkor Wat!!  The Americans had done some precise demolishion work on these temples (My Son), but there are still some impressive remains.  A boat trip back provided a pleasant way to see the bank of the river and we were provided with lunch (or should i say a snack) of rice and a banana!
</P><P>
</P><P>Another afternoon, another chance to be persuaded to have another suit made.  This time Duane is drawn into buying a pure Kashmir suit (very nice it is too) and Freddy gets the first of what will turn out to be many purchases.  We spend the evening, like most evenings, playing pool and then heading to the busiest bar we can find.  We spend the night drinking with some English and Australians and i get into a heated debate with an American - they are fun to argue with!
</P><P>
</P><P>So, with clouds still in sky and the threat of rain on the horizon, we head off for our suit fittings.  My DJ is perfect as is Duanes 3 piece suit and so we decide to get another each.  More measuring and banter with the girls and so yet another day to spend in Hoi An.  There`s only so much wandering up and down the river you can do.
</P><P>
</P><P>With their Visa`s dangerously close to expiring we part ways with Glenn and Freddy (not before Freddy orders another suit) as they head off to Saigon.  A most enjoyable time spent with those lads and i wish them all the best (although they will never read this blog, far too busy for that sort of thing).
</P><P>
</P><P>Our suits are finished, the postwoman has come and taken our money and our suits (with a little insurance, but i would have liked a little more) and we are ready to head to Nha Trang.  I`ve never realy enjoyed shopping before. Is there hope for me yet?</P><hr size='1'><H2>The party capital</H2><H3>2007-05-02 to 2007-05-08</H3><P>So we appear early (far too early) in the party capital of Vietnam, Nha Trang, minus our previous travelling buddies and so in need of some more.  After some recuperative sleep we set out to explore the beach and surrounding town.  The fact you have to pay for a sunbed takes a bit of getting used too - it wouldn`t be allowed in India and so we resort to sitting on the sand.  The sea is warm and the beach is not too polluted and so we set off in search of a cheap, but safe looking diving centre. 
</P><P>
</P><P>Duane pays his money and so is set up on his 4 day open water diver course and i pay to join him on his four open water dives (the fact that i am already qualified i enjoying bragging about for the next few days.  What are friends for?)  So with Duane set for school the next day and the general lack of sleep catching up fast we get an early night. 
</P><P>
</P><P>What is there to do in Nha Trang apart from sitting on the beach?  Today my mission is to answer such a question.  I befriend an easy-rider who, in return for me thinking about taking his bike to Hanoi, gives me a tour of the sites.  Off to the Long Son Pagoda that is famous for its giant Budda on top of the hill and it`s lying Budda (a white copy of the Golden one in Bangkok) where i am eagerly shown round by one of the orphans that the monks look after and he even manages to convince me to buy some postcards for the good of his school (I`m looking after my Karma levels!).  Next on my tour was a drive past the fishing village to the Charm Towers, Hindu temples this time.  I feel, after experiencing the wonder of the temples in India, this particular set of temples was lost on me, it was also far too hot.  My guide left me at the Dam market where i wondered around explaining to people that i already have a "good morning Vietnam" T-shirt (for my more touristic days) and so another would just be greedy. 
</P><P>
</P><P>I had recently broken the screen of my camera (careless i know but it was it or me!) and so i got some directions from my landlord to a place that could help, commandeered a passing cyclo driver that could speak some English and went off to discuss repairs.  The chap, whilst sitting over a dismantled camera (fag in hand), informed my driver it could be fixed and i was invited back the next day.  My trust in Vietnamese workmanship was not high and so it was tentatively that i left my camera in the shop, receipt in hand (if that`s what it could be called) 
</P><P>
</P><P>Back home via the beach to find Duane back after a hard day learning about buoyancy and proving he could swim.  Time to eat and have a couple of drinks, but the heat and exertion of the day proved too much for the pair of us as we collapsed into a blissful sleep. 
</P><P>
</P><P>My easy-rider appears again, determined to take me to his shop (echos of India) and so, after using his services to do a few chores i have for the day, i pay lip service to the owner and promise to discuss the idea with Duane.  The camera is repaired.  Dare i say it better than new and so after many thank yous (a little piece of Vietnamese i have picked up) i rushed off to take as many photos as possible and kill the rest of the day on the beach (have i mentioned i hate beach holidays?!) 
</P><P>
</P><P>With the open water dives for both me and Duane approaching in the morning (i was in need of a refreshed) it was a case of early to bed, early to rise and we boarded our boat, manned by a crazy captain (think of a young Captain Ahab, but with both legs!) and we headed out for our dive in the beautiful, coral filled waters around Nha Trang.  On the way back to shore we started racing a much faster boat and so, due to his competitive streak, our captain chose to cut-up our pursuer causing an almighty collisions and both boats had to limp to shore.  This was followed the next day by the successful completion of duanes open water diver qualification and the necessary celebrations were commenced.  Due to this it was an early bedtime again and playful hangovers in the morning.
</P><P>
</P><P>Final day in Nha Trang and so we spent some time on the beach and wondered around the beachside cafes, drinking coffee.  Come the evening we met Susan (the German we met in Sapa) and some British (Alison, Gemma, Andrew and Alistair) and so h ad a good old fashioned British piss up before catching our bus the next evening to Ho Chi Minh City.  To the south we go.....................</P><hr size='1'><H2>Saigon</H2><H3>2007-05-09 to 2007-05-14</H3><P>Without hesitation we were drawn to the Museum of American War Crimes (re-named The War Remnants Museum so as not to offend the delicate sensibilities of a dollar spending nation). Emotive photos and big guns all carefully positioned to transform groups of mellow pacafists into angry lynch mobs that hurriedly pursue groups of fanny-packed tourists around the boulevards of HCMC. In order to collect our thoughts and sharpen our pitchforks we ducked into a bar for a coffee. If Saigon had an underground maffia fit for a Quentin Tarentino film then this certainly was where it hung out. The place was packed with Vitnamese man in sharp, tailored suits being waited upon by skimply-but-tastefuly-dressed girls and the whole show was delightfully choreographed to unusual flourishes of Vietnamese hip-hop amongst a backdrop of British pop. After politely pointing out to the waitress that we were not American we were provided with endless cups of tea. Later we bumped into a chap in the park with whom we had been brinking with in Nha Trang and after setting a time and place for dinner, pointed us in the direction of the (Re?)unification Palace. Once the seat of government in the days of South Viet Nam the place had been left, like the Mary Celeste , exactly as it was fled from as the tanks rolled through the gates in `75. Very interesting place not least as an essay in 1960s architecture, fixtures and fittings. Wondering back, having aquired a pair of Cambodian visas from the local embassy, we nipped into Notre Dame de Sai Gon where my sensitive travelling companion was horrified to find a kitsch sculpture of notre Dame above the alter behaloed with a neon light and "Ave Maria" written across her chest in pink, neon tubbing. After such iconoclastic visions we quickly scuttled back to the travellers quarter to make ourselves ready for dinner. Dinner was a grand affair since we had contacted all the people we knew to be in Saigon and rquested their company at our table. The night lasted well into itself and after an abortive attempt by me to lead a team into the heart of darkness (Apocalypse Now - a club - was closed by the time we arrived) the early hours found us in the company of Gemma (GB), Susan (D) and Nick (D) laconicaly drinking rum in the Go, Go, Go Bar.</P><hr size='1'><H2>Time to explore the Mekong</H2><H3>2007-05-13 to 2007-05-15</H3><P>On our trip thus far we have been able to aquaint ourselves with a number of rivers, none more-so than the mighty Gangees; however, we felt that we hadn`t given the Mekong the attention it deserved, especially as it would be accompaning us on our trip north through Cambodia and Laos.  How better to get a feel for a river than on a three day boat trip?
</P><P>
</P><P>On a dark and dank morning, joined by our water proof macks and our new travelling buddies, the lovely Gemma, Alison and Susan, we headed off to our boat with our enthusiastic guide and went to one of the many islands on the Mekong delta.  Here the woman make coconut candy (very nice) and the men drink and play cards (so i at least have my retirement sorted).  We had Vietanamese tea and got to hold a python (much to Duane`s apprehension).
</P><P>
</P><P>A short trip further around the delta and the heavens opened - clever British boys and girls had water proofs though - and we were rowed up a small channel to eat some fresh fruit and listen to some traditional Vietnam music.  The fruit was lovely!!!
</P><P>
</P><P>Back to shore, Can Tho, and we are checked into an hotel and headout for dinner by the river and sample some of the very cheap and suprisingly good local beer, we are also able to pay our respects to a massive statue of Uncle Ho (as he is affectionately now known)
</P><P>
</P><P>Another day and anther early start as we head off to the Cai Rang – Phong Dien Floating Market.  The boats are clearly showing off their wares with samples of their produce set high on masts above their boats.  Everything is available for people feeling a little worse for wear be it fruit, water or even a cold beer (some of these travelling types are big drinkers!)  We`re then wisked off to see how rice noodles are made, saw some pigs on the farm next to the rice noodles (much to Duanes delight) and taken to Chau Doc for the evening and the opportunity to climb Sam Mountain and visit The Thien Hau Temple.  Being adventurous sorts, we embarked on the climb with the rain begining to fall.  The view from the top at sunset is fantastic, we have been told, as when we arrived the monsoon opened up in all its glory and we were hard pushed to see each other.  Back down the mountain, off to our hotel to dry off and then to bed.
</P><P>
</P><P>Another early rise and after going to a rice wine making factory and a crocodile farm our group was disbanded and all those who were going in Cambodia boarded the boat (this included all the girls).  After a pleasant cruise upstream past lots of rural villages and children playing in the river we arrived at the border.  Our guide disappeared off to smooth over the procedure and we had lunch.  Within an hour and a half we were in Cambodian territory, the rural villages were gone, the land was oe massive open plain and it began to rain.
</P><P>
</P><P>Before we knew what had happened we were lakeside in Phnon Penh.  Our tour in Vietnam had come to an end!
</P><P>
</P><P>Due to being a man who has no problems with trying new foods i have been given the unenviable task of eating random foods others want to try.  Due to this i have been able to experience frogs (not very daring, but we did see them strung up live the next day), snake and eel.  Bugs are round the corner, i can feel it!</P><hr size='1'><H2>Cambodia</H2><H3>2007-05-15 to 2007-05-23</H3><P>So with one country recoving from war behind us we head into another.  After disembarking from our boat we got the mini-bus into Phnom Penh and chose our hostel out from a plethora found by the lakeside.  The lake, a dark expanse of water by that time of night, could be seen from our balcony and so we took our place at one of the many bars lining its side and spent the night enjoying Angkor beer from draft (Cambodia`s finest) and putting the world to right.
</P><P>
</P><P>After so much traveling over the past few days, it called for a late start and a lazy day reading books, lying in hammocks and supping on beer whilst looking over the, suprisingly, lush and green lake.  The day past without event and so plans could be hatched to go and see the sights of Phnom Penh the following day.  This involved watching "the killing fields" to catch up on Cambodian history.
</P><P>
</P><P>The actual killing fields were a dark and harrowing place.  Coming face-to-face with thousands of human skulls is something you can`t really prepare yourself for.  S21 was no improvement.  It was the prison people were kept in, tortured and put to death with a brutality you could easily compare to the Nazi`s.
</P><P>
</P><P>A day of rest was needed to recover before we headed north to Siem Reap.  Everyone has heard of the temples so we decided to see what else the city had to offer.  A stroll around the old market killed some time and brought much amusement and the evening was filled wih the FA cup final (comiserations to Man U fans).
</P><P>
</P><P>So Angkor Wat - it all began with a sunset from Phnom Bakheng (along with every other tourist in Siem Reap) which was spectacular and well worth the time.  Early to bed and up before dawn to watch the sun reise over Angkor Wat - undescribable!!!!!  After sunrise and a well deserved breakfast myself, Duane, Gemma and Alison (the girls were hard to shake off ;) ) we went into Angkor Thom and saw the marvel of the Bayon, the terrace of the elephants,  the terrace of the lepar king and Phimeanakas.  By this point the heat was unbarable, but we battled on.  We visited Preah Khan (my favourite temple) and Ta Prohm before heading back to Angkor Wat.  This was enough for us and we headed back to Siem Reap for some well deserved rest.
</P><P>
</P><P>Time to think about leaving Cambodia (and the girls) and not wanting to go back to Phnom Penh meant we had to head to Kampong Cham (a little north of the capital).  It is a delightful French colonialistic town with nothing to do in it and so we got some money from the bank (SE Asia doesn`t believe in ATM`s), found a friendly English owned bar and drank Guinness.  The next day we headed north again to Stung Treng (the border crossing town and so lots of people in transit).  We had run out of cash, had no means of getting it and so started getting things on tick from our tour company and eventually Mr. Mo.  Absolutely nothing to do in Stung Treng and so we booked our journey to Don Dat on the 4000 islands just inside Laos, went to bed (we think the room next door was a brothel) and got ready for another border crossing.
</P><P>
</P><P>Lots of history and emotion in Cambodia and i don`t think we had the time to do it justice, but we have heard Laos is all fun and games so the next week or so should be interesting!</P><hr size='1'><H2>Lao</H2><H3>2007-05-24 to 2007-06-06</H3><P>We arrived on a small island in the middle on the Me kong just north of the Lao border with no money. The island was called Dan Dat and our host was called Mr Mo. We opened up a credit account with Mr Mo and then went about doing nothing for two days except for lying around in hammocks, swimming in the river, jumping out of trees and drinking far too much lao lao (I shudder to even recall its name). Time was against us and so we had to leave Don Dat. Mr Mo`s man escorted us to Pakse to settle our tab and after an afternoon drinking coffee and reading in a popular Indian cafe we found ourselves on the nicest bus I have ever encountered on our way to Vientiane. After 40 minutes in the capital (I had it on good authority that the place was quite the dullest city on the Earth) we were on another bus to Vang Vieng.What to say about Vang Vieng. The town exists for the utter gratification of those childish tendencies that growing up is supposed to quash and university fosters. A giant adventure play ground for 20-something-year-old children with beer. So for five days we floated down the river in large inner tubes getting slowly merry on Beer Lao and compulsory free shots of lao lao, swinging or increasingly higher rope swings and regressing by about twenty years. For those times when tubing was not an option the town offered that perpetual Sunday morning comfort zone. It was compulsory to recline on the cushions in the cafes and all the tables faced a TV that was endlessly screening Friends or the Simpsons. On one particular occasion I did manage to fall into a 7 hour Friends frenzy unable to leave until I was certain that Ross and Rachael would finally get it together in the end. It was in Vang Vieng that we met Freddy again. This of course put our departure date back another couple of days. However, when we finally got around to leaving we found ourselves in Luang Pra Bang in the early twentieth century with all the French colonial ... je ne sais quoi still as charming now as it must have been in `39. We spent our time here lazily drinking coffee but one day took ourselves to a water fall for some swimming (and unplanned hiking) and a couple of bears and a tiger thrown in for good measure. After Luang Pra Bang two more days up the Me Kong by boat and we were leaving Lao behind us.</P><hr size='1'><H2>a review of the antics of the famous travelling duo, Duane & Dion, on the Thai mainland.</H2><H3>2007-06-08 to 2007-06-12</H3><P>Well since Dion is these days always at least 18 metres below sea level I have taken it upon myself, yes sans encouragement, to bring chaps and chapettes at home up to date (again). We finally left Laos, Freddy, Rob and the less civilised world far (3 days by boat) behind us and arrived in Chang Mai at around the time that we in this part of the world like to think it appropriate to start drinking. Since Wikitravel had nothing extrordinary to say about Thailands northern metropolis apart from providing a long list of bars we decidied to look around and to our surprise we found a lot of bars. Having beat some locals at Jenga and thus procured some nasty shots of vodka we finaly settleded upon patronising an English ex-pat with a juke box full of old Manchester tunes. Dragging a meagre tail eager English adventurers behind him our braumeister closed his bar and led us to another where he could also enjoy the national pass time. Having exhausted what Chang Mai had to offer the next day we bought a train ticket for an evening departure to Bangkok. This left us with a whole day to experience the coffee shops. This done we caught our train and headed south. 
</P><P>
</P><P>Arrival in Bangkok was at 6:30 in the morning and as i had securred accomodation with a lethargic cousin it seemed an inappropriate time to check in. So after much impossibility trying to explain to the taxi guys taht we did not need a hotel we went to the post office to send some unecessaries back to Blighty. Then Breakfast and Dion encouraging local girls to do his sewing for him and by now it was mid-day so we sky-trained it to our accomodation. After the usual catch-up converstaions and cups of tea between relatives who have not seem each other for a while Dion and I left my cousin to do some work and went to starbucks for the afternoon - the first place we could find with air-con. That evening my cousin`s hospitality knew no bounds as we were toured all the night spots of that famous capital starting in a huge indoor / out door night market with gallons of beer and the biggest kareoke stage i have ever had the pleasure (?) to be audience to. The next day we headed to the Khao San road to get back with our own and find a bus to the deep south. This been done we wondered to the King`s palace and arrived back at my cousins house in time for dinner and some last night drinks. This time we opted for a small Thai beer garden accross the road where white peole were very welcome as the stuff of myth and legend, never before beheld. The next day after a late breakfast we sky-trained back to Khao San to while away the few hour we had left in Bangkok. That evening we were on a bus headed for Koh Pha Ngan.</P><hr size='1'><H2>and so onto the islands - where to start?</H2><H3>2007-06-12 to 2007-06-23</H3><P>After a entertaining stay in Bangkok it was time to organise our VIP bus (the only way to travel) and head down to Surat Thani and onto our boat to Koh Pangan.  We arrived and moved into our hotel (Mac`s bay) where our beach side bungalow overlooked the white sand, blue sea and off in the distance was Ko Samui.  Our landlady, Lope, was an ex-pat and clearly an ex-traveller and so was the source of any information about SE Asia, Australia, New Zealand......lets just say anywhere in the world.......you could possibly want.  So we settled in, got used to our pool, met the other guests and worked on the tan.
</P><P>
</P><P>The Mac`s bay resort was the location of the black moon party.  Smaller scale and less well heard of than the full moon, but we were promised a good night.  So after realxing all day and stocking up on supplies of alcohol to be hidden in our bungalow, the trance was turned up, people began to arrive (we didn`t have to pay for our ticket!) and the party got started.  From here on in everything is an awesome blur.  It rained a couple of times, so we got wet.  The music failed a couple of times, so people danced to tunes in there heads.  I`d like to say there was a sing-song, but i`m pretty sure that never happened.
</P><P>
</P><P>After adorning myself with my luminous tatoo (that washed off in the next rain shower) the sun began to rise and a few hours later the party died down.  Raving after dawn - quite an experience!  Lope appeared, uncalled for, on the dancefloor with cups of tea (legend) and we sloped off to our balconies and chatted until we had wined down enough to sleep.
</P><P>
</P><P>A couple of days to recover in the pool and on the beach in the sunshine and then we decided that it was time to move on.  Off to Koh Tao and dive school.  If you don`t do any diving on Koh Tao, there isn`t a lot else to do (as Duane can testify to) and so i went off on my course and Duane caught up on some of his favourite authors.  
</P><P>
</P><P>The diving was incredible.  Not so much for the coral (it was pretty badly damaged) but for the marine life.  Massive schools of fish over a thousand strong, turtles and a juvenile Whale Shark.  Awesome!!!!
</P><P>
</P><P>After a few more days just lying around on the beach we organised ourselves a trip into Malaysia and Kuala Lumpa.  The overnight slow boat from Koh Tao took us back to Surat Thani and from there we caught a mini-bus to the border.  After a slight mix-up and a little heated debate we then got on a luxury bus that took us the remaining 8 hours to KL where we arrived at 12am, went straight to China town - had a beer and went to bed.
</P><P>
</P><P>KL.  What a city.  We got up, took the tube and got to KLCC (Kuala Lumpa Conference Centre) the home of the Petronas towers (depending on your classifiaction they are the largest pair of towers in the world and the 3rd largest buildings).  They are massive!  Didn`t get there early enough to go to the skybridge, but were told the view from the KL tower (the fifth tallest tower in the world) was far superior, as you could get higher up it.  It was spectcular and greatly helped with our further navigation of the city.
</P><P>
</P><P>Off to Times Sqaure - the largest shopping mall i have ever seen.  KL does it big!!  We got lost in electronic shops for a while.  I bought a cheap, but pretty cool new mp4 player and we went to the theme park on the top floor.  Lots of roller-coasters and fair ground attractions - it was like being 12 again.
</P><P>
</P><P>After a brief wander around the street stalls in China town (cheap hoddies for the on-coming cold) we returned to KLCC to see Petronas at night and it didn`t disappoint.  So ends our SE Asia experience and it is back to the Western[ised] world.  Just one final stop before that though - the greatest ariport in the world.........Singapore!</P><hr size='1'><H2>Bangers & Mash, Roast Beef & Branston Pickle in Brisbane.</H2><H3>2007-06-26 to 2007-07-03</H3><P>Australia is a strange sort of place on the other side of the world. Here you will find coffee in tea bags, winter in summer and the locals enjoying the few days of rain that June provides for the whole year. Here we arrived, in Brisbane and proceeded to get aquainted with the local tipple introduced to us by the esteemed cousin of my most highly esteemed trvelling companion. The best thind about this side of the world is that you can pretend that you are on the other side of the world. Back home, in Blighty, I mean. Super markets sell what one would expect and even sell it in English. So our first week in Australia was spent making Shepheards Pies, mashing potatos and devouring round after round of cheese and pickle sandwiches. And of course washing it down with plenty of vinum, which is unfortunatly absent in other parts of the world. I would like to say that we did more but a irresistable sence of `we have come home` overcame our travel worn enthusiasm and it was all too easy to sit back and watch Neighbours on the TV. The delights of the city did not entirely ellude us however we dragged ourselves away from the sofa on day and made it to the Brisbane Museum to aquainte ourselves with the great Captain James Cook and another day we managedto stroll through the trees along the South Bank of the Brisbane river. On our last night staying with cousin Julia, her chap, James organised a terrific trip into Brisbane`s district of indulgence, the Valley. Her we danced and drank the finest Tasmanian Champagne before we were moved to another cousin`s house the next day. Emilina had had us over to her house for a roast beef dinner earlier in the week and we had had great fun playing with her small, small children now we arrived on the saturday night to show the girl some good old fashioned English drinking fun while the kids were staying with dad. In this, of course, we suceeded. After a while everyone had doned ceremonial dressing gowns in order to chase the night into the morning and it is needless to say that when the children returned the next evening the adults had not been risen long. That evening was spent watching Harry Potter and Beauty and the Beast as most evenings in households with children are. The next day the children were sent to day care so that once again the adults could have fun and this time we took ourselves to a Koala (not bear) sanctury so that I could feed the Kangaroos and hold a Koala. That evening with the advent of another relative, Dion`s charming aunt Helen, we comenced the drinking once again and talked and sang well into the evening. A successful start to our Australian adventure.</P><hr size='1'><H2>A whole lot of sand!</H2><H3>2007-07-03 to 2007-07-08</H3><P>The time finally came when the comforts of Brisbane had to be given up and we had to make progress north.  Booked on a greyhound bus (too poor for the Oz experience) we headed off to Hervey Bay to experience what it is like by the seaside.  We checked into a cheap, lovely, but empty hostel and planned our trip over to Fraiser.
</P><P>
</P><P>There isn`t much to do in Hervey bay and so the next day was spenting milling around on the beacha nd then watching Transformers (a little bit disappointed with it to be honest!).  Our Fraiser island experience was with a tour - partly beacuse Duane still doesn`t trust me as a driver, but mostly because we didn`t have enough people to make a self driver cost effective.  Had a great time swimming in cold lakes and walking across large expances of sand with the Hump back whales visible just off the shore.  The night spent in the hotel was passed in drinking games and a cross-dressing theme night in the local bar with people i have never learnt the names of.  The french guy had a habit of remembering peoples countries, not names and so the people became France, Poland, Switzerland, Sweeden and Mexico (if any of you are reading this then "Hi!"
</P><P>
</P><P>Back to Hervey bay for a BBQ (couldn`t be in Australia long without one) and to sort out our next bus north.  Had to find a way to get to Kroombit ranch - not and easy goal, but for experienced travellers like ourselves anything is possible.......</P><hr size='1'><H2>Kroombit Cowboy (Ringer) College.</H2><H3>2007-07-08 to 2007-07-14</H3><P>I have just graduated from cowboy college having spent the last week on the back of a horse herding live stock in the central Queensland outback while installing a 3 tonne beer fridge and drinking rum and dust in the evenings and shooting shotguns for the hell of it to a Dolly Parton-esque soundtrack. This was Kroombit cattle Station. Recomendeed to us by a girl in a tube on a river in Laos as an excellent place to have fun and save money in Australia by doing a little casual labour. She was right - brilliant fun. Although a working cattle station, the farm also hosts the `oz-experience` travellers as they pass up and down the east coast and so every afternoon and eveing a new bus load of young folk would arrive looking for the real outback experience and it was up to us to give it to them. This meant learning fast. "Be happy and enthusiastic and look like you have done it a million times before," Replied Andrew when I asked what a goat rodeo was as he drove us to give hima hand running it on our first day. Wrestling goats for the delight of the paying puntters was the answer that he refrained from giving me. But while the cooler in the ute still had a couple of cans of Bunderburg left there was no shortage of enthusiasm the same applied to the clay pigeon shooting, of which Dion with equal enthusiam fell into the roll of master of the trap. Now this job was not all fun and games. I should let it be known that it was up to us to wash the canyons of dirty dishes that appeared after dinner in the evenings. And too to us fell the task of installing a new beer fridge for the bar. Now we were in Australia. they drink a lot of beer in Australia. Also we were in the out back. This means that there is a lot of room. So our fridge was naturally not your every day domestic device. The three tonne shipping container had to be raised above the ground on stilts, which were to be crafted and installed by you two humble English enginers. We rose to the task (at 6 every morning; a cold time of day for those who had spent the proceeding 16 weeks in the very hot) and in fact quite enjoyed it. And when we weren`t diggin holes, wrestling goats, shooting pigeons, riding horses or washing dishes we found time for a good old fashin hoe-down. Absolutely amazing. I want to go back.</P><hr size='1'><H2>Time for something a little more tropical</H2><H3>2007-07-14 to 2007-07-19</H3><P>Whether it be the need to dangle from a cable over the canopy of the rainforest, dive on a natural phenomena visible from the moon (apparently!) or just hang-out playing poker for monopoly money and having BBQ`s then Cairnes is the place to be.  We arrived late in the day and were suprised and a little lost not to have a collection of people ready to whisk us away to our hostel and so we had to find one ourselves.  With that panic over we headed out into town to soak up a bit of the party atmosphere and plan our stay.
</P><P>
</P><P>We wanted to go over the canopy of the rainforest (which also gave us the chance to ride on a Harry Potter style train - excitment for the new book was building) and so we booked that and it was well worth the trip.  Stunning landscape!  We wanted to dive on the reef and so headed out over the rough seas to the outer reef where we dived with Sharks and a massive Grouper.  Our guide was a bit of a tool but he couldn`t speak when we were under water so it was all good.
</P><P>
</P><P>Apart from that we met some French girls (Celine and Cindy) who were good enough to do a BBQ for us (very nice it was too) and we passed many an hour sitting around with our goon playing poker.
</P><P>
</P><P>A wonderful part of the world and it was warm again.  Sydney next and so the jackets are being preped for wearing.</P><hr size='1'><H2>Sydney.</H2><H3>2007-07-19 to 2007-07-25</H3><P>We arrived off the plane st about 9 in the mornign and got a taxi straight to the house of our most hospitable hosts: The Delaneys. Then, having enjoyed a fortifying breakfast headed into town to see that opera house. Well as you can imagine the opera house was the same as it is in all the photos but the harbour bridge is slightly more impressive in real life. That night we were taken for drinks at the local club and talked all night on every subject. The next day we headed back into the city and headed for the observatory to look at telescopes and the like and after this we headed over the bridge to get a glimpse of the harbour from the other side. That night we explored the darker side of Sydney with a couple of drinks in Kings Cross. The day after Dion stumbbled across a book that took his fancy and for the next two days read it. Once Harry Potter was dead. We resumed our sight seeing, ascending the Sydney tower to gaze over the city and popping into the aquanrium which was really good. For all this time we were treated to lovely food, good conversation and excelent company by the Delaney family - thank you very much.</P><hr size='1'><H2>Around the princes highway</H2><H3>2007-07-25 to 2007-08-02</H3><P>Being in Sydney and wanting to be in Melbourne gave me a chance to flex some driving muscles and tak on the winding and twisty roads of the Princes highway (and surrounding detours).  My continual search for an ever more bendy road frequently took us miles out of the way, but i was having fun and Duane was reading about wizards and Dark Lords (probably for the best as he is not the worlds best passenger!)  A couple of days later we arrived safely and without incident in Melbourne and moved into the Ritz (the backpacking hostel above the pub where the neighbours night is held).
</P><P>
</P><P>The hostel was filled with long-term Australia travellers and so they were a working bunch fresh from the norh and the trials and tribulations of fruit picking.  We were made welcome and encouraged to drink...........i think we found a place we could settle in for a while.  Our time in Melbourne was eventful.  Duane proved to be a man of many talents when he won a trip to Sydney in a sing the neighbours theme tune competition (was even complimented be Mal Kennedy!!), the hostel provided a free cheese and goon night, and there was the obligitory meeting with Dr. Karl (came second in the neighbours quiz too, but there`s no prizes for second!)
</P><P>
</P><P>That`s the Oz experience done and dusted and so our thoughts have turned to the country over the ditch with it`s cold weather and snow.......</P><hr size='1'><H2>Christchurch, NZ.</H2><H3>2007-08-02 to 2007-08-07</H3><P>Arriving in Australia was like coming home to an England that seemed quite familiar at first but revealed its perculiarities once the jet-lag had abaited. Arriving in New Zealand was like coming home to England but with fush and chups. Christchurch, described as the most English city in the southern hemisphere, reminded me of a city produced from the mixing of 14th century Oxford and contemporary Slough. Walking down Cambridge St. and Glouster St. to the botanic gardens one found, not Gum trees and Eucalyptus, but trees that would not look out of place in a park in Derbyshire. The birds sang English tunes and a man wearing a boater could even be hired to punt you down the river Avon. The choice of English pubs serving English food with English ales next to log fires was a little disconcerting at first but we soon found our feet. The only place that indicated that we were indeed not being rained on in the UK was the museum in which the exhibits of Maori history and Antarctic expeditions reaffirmed our 43 degrees south. Gemma and Alison, whom we had left in Siem Reap, Cambodia after a long day wondering around Angkor, arrived on the sunday and so the company was terrifically assembled to endulge our anglophilic appetites. After picking up a camper van for a month we took a day trip to the delightful Banks peninsula for fush and chups by the sea before once again parting company with a few English pints in a few English pubs and a promise to meet up in San Fransisco. See you there girls!</P><hr size='1'><H2>The South of the South</H2><H3>2007-08-07 to 2007-08-14</H3><P>We headed out from Christchurch full of petrol and raring to go, with dreams and aspirations of climbing the infamous Mount Cook and taking in the sights and beauty of as many of the LOTR locations that we could possibly find.  With time on our side, we parked up in Lake Tekapo, tried to cook a meal on a camping stove and tested out the camper van...........woke up a little sore, but i`m sure it just takes a bit of getting used to.
</P><P>
</P><P>It seems Mount Cook is one oif the toughest climbs in the world and so we satisfied oursslves with a walk to the base of the Hooker glacier which runs down Mount Cook and headed to Queenstown.  This was a fact-finding mission.  We booked skiing, watched people trwon themselves off bridges and headed off in the direction of Milford sounds (que the rain).
</P><P>
</P><P>The rain didn`t close the road or cause any avalanches (hence why i can keep you updated!) but it did ruin the view of Milford sounds and cause many unseen waterfalls to errupt from the surrounding hills (evey cloud has a silver lining).
</P><P>
</P><P>Time to head around the coastal highway to visit some of the more random and small settlements in NZ.  The largest town in Catlins had 300 odd residents (massive!), but the scenery was beautiful, the campsites were cheap and we are developing a close relationship with our van!
</P><P>
</P><P>Road to Dunedin to attempt to see Albatrosses (you had to pay so we didn`t!), elephant seals (an uncomfirmed sighting) and spherical boulders (they don`t move so a big tick for that one!!!)  We then took a meandering road back towards Queenstown and stayed in what was probably once a prison in Alexander (the town that only has one claim to fame - a massive clock on the hill.  Very usful for tewlling the time, but terribly random!)
</P><P>
</P><P>So, we find ourselves back in Queenstown and, against my mothers good advice, i have thrown myself off a 43m high bridge and lived to tell the tale.  Tomorrow skiing begins and our thoughts have to turn to our expedition north!</P><hr size='1'><H2>Ski School; On the Piste (apologies for the pun).</H2><H3>2007-08-15 to 2007-08-18</H3><P>Well we arrived back in Queenstown and sat aroung in our shorts while we washed all our clothes - this illustrating the down side of living out of a van - and an early night was called for since the bell was sent for 06:30. The bus picked us up the next morning at 07:30 and we headed up to The Remarkables. Kitted out we headed of to our first lesson I opted for the ab initio class and Dion headed off somewhere else. It turns out that I`m naturally a very good skier perfectly performing pizzas and parallel turns in the snow, whilst not forgeting to lob the odd snowball at my class mates. This fun, early nights and earlier morning lasted for three days by which time my legs were jelly and my snow plows were sloppy so I removed my skis and walked down the piste to head back to Queenstown. 
</P><P>
</P><P>Right no sensible period of time, during any holiday, should be spent away from the hard liquor and after three days of responsible sleeping we were cutting it fine. Fortunately Queenstown expects this and so armed with discount vouchers and the promise of free shoys of this and that we marched in to town. A dink here, a drink there a teapot and a Jaegerbomb chaser is a fine way to start an evening off and taging along with our old room mates we ploughed on into the night. 
</P><P>
</P><P>The next day we had to move hostels, but on the recomendation of the boys who Jaeger-carpet-bombed us the night before this involved driving 100m down the road. After much lying in front of the TV night arrived again and the same band of merry revellers once more headed out. A few quiet pints and an early night soon turned into enough Jaegermeister to slay a herd of wolly mamoths and another early morning trip to Winnie`s to dance off any remaining dignity.</P><hr size='1'><H2>North - West - North - East - North</H2><H3>2007-08-19 to 2007-08-22</H3><P>With the all action, adrenaline capital of the world safely behind us we set out to explore the temperate rainforest and glacier covered West coast of NZ.  An epic drive across snow covered mountains to the sea took us within spitting distance of the Franz Josef glacier (so named because it looks like Austro-Hungarian leaders beard) and so we put on our crampons and headed up the icey face.  Spectacular blue coloured ice caves and stunning views down the valley were in store for us.  Money well spent.
</P><P>
</P><P>With the luxury of a hostel, we bought some beer and settled down to watch Arnie at his best, protecting a young John Connor.
</P><P>
</P><P>Leving the West coast sea, the time had come to change islands and so we took the treacherous crossing of Auther`s pass over towards Christchurch and headed north. A brief camp was called for in order to regain our strength and then we made it to the ferry crossing, borded the most expensive ferry in the world and were deposited near the centre of Wellington.  north island here we come!</P><hr size='1'><H2>The North Island.</H2><H3>2007-08-24 to 2007-08-26</H3><P>From Wellington we drove to Taumatawhakatanginangakoavavotamateaturipukakapikimaungahoronukupokaiwhenvakitanatahu which claims to have the logest name in the world (ousting the train station in Whales) and I believe it does however the only thing here is a sign in a layby giving its name and a hill in the distance and obviously a couple of sheep. So we drove on and spent the night in Napier a town eith a love afair with the art-deco. The next day we drove on up past lake Taupo to Rotorua and walked amougnst the pools of bubbling mud and enjoying the sulphuric air caused by local volcanic activity. That night we stayed in Tongariro National Park at the foot of Mount Doom, well that`s what the elves call it. The next day we headed back towards Wellington and stayed in Upper Hutt.</P><hr size='1'><H2>The end days!</H2><H3>2007-08-26 to 2007-08-30</H3><P>With time in NZ drawing to a close it was time to assess what there was left to do.  One more LOTR film and an epic voyage from Wellington to Christchurch.  So we stumbled onto Upper Hutt - described as the dormitory of Wellington - and were put up by Tabitha and Chris.  While they went off to school we became aquainted with Upper Hutt (it didn`t take long) and NZ TV.  With Duane`s replacement passport ready and nothing stopping us now we set off to Auckland.
</P><P>
</P><P>Little to say about the trip.  Charged MP3 players more than made up for the lack of a working radio and we made it to Auckland without drama and even found the hotel with no trouble at all (stuff like this never happens).
</P><P>
</P><P>We gave back the car - a sad day!  We wandered around Auckland, replenished our depleted reading stock (i have decided to take on some classical literature - complete and unabridged!)  and prepared to cross the date line, travel back in time and take on American customs.  Wish us luck!</P><hr size='1'><H2>Sweet dreams my LAX</H2><H3>2007-08-30 to 2007-09-03</H3><P><P>Change of country, time zone and date.&nbsp; Que the longest day ever which caused Thursday to run for 42 hours.&nbsp; There seemed only one way to cope with such a body shattering experience and that was to invoke international jet-lag laws and have a drink (well before the 4 o`clock watershed!)&nbsp; With ourselves in a very American British pub we staring putting away the Guinness and then wandered along Santa Monica pier being terribly British and probably a little annoying.</P><P>With the required hangover settled in we planned our stay in LA.&nbsp; A trip down to Venice beach to see the street performers, Muscle beach (Duane and I decided not to work out)&nbsp;and some of the most honest beggars in the world - they only wanted money for weed!</P><P>When in LA you have to take on Hollywood and so we borded the bus (wonderful system, i don`t know what people complain about) and found the avenue of the stars.&nbsp; Tourist central and full of lookalikes (a poor attempet at Alistor Moody attempted to cast a spell on me - lets hope it didn`t work).&nbsp; Feeling like finding some stars we bought a map of there houses and hit Beverly Hills.&nbsp; Foudn the playboy mansion and wandered down Rodeo, but then decided enough was enough.&nbsp; We briefly visited the Tar pits where Mamoths had famously been found after they fell in and then went home.</P><P>Duane was determind to do something cultered in LA and so we went to the Getty.&nbsp; Lots of Americans crowded round something by Manet (wasn`t that good) and we saw lots of art.&nbsp; the building was the most impressive thing about the gallery.&nbsp; Spectacular architecture, with the promise of views of LA if the smog ever lifts.</P><P>LA the place of the beautiful people, cars and excessive heat.&nbsp; Time for a touch more culture as we head to&nbsp;`Frisco`</P></P><hr size='1'><H2>.........flowers in your hair!!</H2><H3>2007-09-03 to 2007-09-07</H3><P>After enough of the manufactured, beautiful people vibe of LA we headed off to Sna Francisco upon our air-conditioned shuttle bus provided by the hostel.  The only issue was that the air-con hadn`t been turned on - you have no idea how hot it was.  India and SE Asia were not a patch on it.
</P><P>
</P><P>So, finally, we arrived in Frisco and immediately had a good feel for the place.  More grubby and down to earth than the sprawling mess of LA and most importantly it meant the 3rd meeting between us and Alison and Gemma (for those who need a little refresh - we met in Vietnam, traveled into Cambodia and met again in NZ)
</P><P>
</P><P>For the first time in ages our time was planned for us.  We didn`t have a timetable (we would only have lost them), but the girls made sure we saw all San Fran had to offer in the time we had.  We visited the Rock, the Golden Gate Bridge, had a meal in little Italy, went out drinking and even visited the Mission which has a reputation and so the girls wanted to wait until some protection came.  In the end they had to make do with me and Duane.
</P><P>
</P><P>We must have done something right though, as the girls extended their holiday by 2 weeks, hired a car with us and we plan to head south to San Diego, into the desert to see a meteorite crater (yes i am a geek!) and off to Vegas.  Let the good times roll.
</P><P>
</P><P>For all those who care.............we may even pop into Orange County!  If you want any messages passed on, please let me know!</P><hr size='1'><H2>Road Trip: we`ve been having fun, driving in the sun.</H2><H3>2007-09-07 to 2007-09-19</H3><P><P>In the words of Gemma and Alison:&nbsp; "So with `Hotel California` blasting out of the stereo we took to the&nbsp;road to travel the famous&nbsp;Highway 1 coastal route bound for San Diego.&nbsp;&nbsp;With stops in Santa Cruz, Cambria,&nbsp;and even `The OC` itself - Newport Beach - we had an amazing few days&nbsp;and a great start to our `extended adventure.`&nbsp;[unable to say goodbye the girls had to extend their trip by two weeks].&nbsp;There was a slight hiccup in Santa Barbara when&nbsp;Dion kept navigating us into a car park that `wasn`t there`. </P><P>Back on the road, after the slight delay we moved onwards to San Diego with spectacular scenery all the way.&nbsp; The Californian coast is stunning - rivalling New Zealand in its rugged beauty and surpassing it in that it wasn`t so damn cold when we stopped to take photographs!</P><P>We stopped in San Diego for a couple of nights which gave us all the chance to indulge in some&nbsp;fantastic spanish-inspired &nbsp;cuisine &nbsp;(paella and sangria - yum!) [this was where my Margarita binge began] and more importantly gave Alison the opportunity&nbsp;for her long-awaited&nbsp;visit to San Diego`s famous&nbsp;Zoo.&nbsp; Thank god for Dion&nbsp;accompanying her and allowing Duane and I to chill out in the animal-free park instead! [Amen to that, cheers mate].</P><P>An epic drive&nbsp;across the border to Arizona was next on the trip and after&nbsp;8 hours of travelling (with only 3 CD`s we were already tiring of to choose&nbsp;between!) [and the girls skipping all the good tracks] we finally arrived in Flagstaff, gateway to the Grand Canyon.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our day at the Canyon was&nbsp;absolutely incredible.&nbsp; None of us really had any idea what&nbsp;to expect of this&nbsp;immense natural wonder but it`s safe to say that we were&nbsp;all pretty much blown away on first sight.&nbsp; We spent the day&nbsp;in the national park picnicking with the squirrels whilst looking over the Canyon (shame about the view hey Duane?!) and then headed back for a chilled out evening.</P><P>The next day was spent in `Dion`s world` with a visit to the Meteor Crater in the middle of the&nbsp;desert. &nbsp;&nbsp;At first neither&nbsp;Alison or myself thought we would be&nbsp;particulary impressed by a big hole in the ground (even if it was created&nbsp;by something from outer space!) but&nbsp;having our personal physics-buff with us meant that the whole&nbsp;visit was so much more interesting.&nbsp;[No one heard Dion complain about having to spend a day looking at fluffy animals in a zoo]</P><P>After&nbsp;a quick stop at the Hoover Dam we crossed into our third state and travelled across the cacti-covered Nevada desert heading for Vegas Baby! We&nbsp;hit Las Vegas Boulevard&nbsp;with music blaring,&nbsp;hanging out of the windows with our cameras ready to snap as many pics as possible of the casinos, hotels and general&nbsp;neon-lit craziness of `the Strip`&nbsp;</P><P>Our fantastic hostel - complete with pool and hot-tub! - was the scene of&nbsp;a drunken first evening`s frolics and a first day`s recovery before we pulled ourselves together, dressed ourselves up and hit the Venetian hotel and casino for a fabulous dinner (thank god for credit cards!)&nbsp; An undoubted&nbsp;highlight of the evening was the 45 minutes we spent watching the fountains outside of the Bellagio (there`s a show every 15 minutes and we&nbsp;stayed&nbsp;for 3 of them - Viva Las Vegas!)&nbsp;[not to mention the yard long Margaritas]</P><P>So having gone out with a bang in&nbsp;Vegas, our&nbsp;last night&nbsp;of what was an amazing road trip was spent in Yosemite national park, relaxing with a delicious dinner and sleeping in log cabins before rising early for our drive&nbsp;back to San Francisco and our last night of our travels."</P><P>Cheers girls (and I don`t just mean for writting my blog for me) it was an excellent adventure in the desert. Gemma your watch is still ticking and I`ve not worn it in the shower yet. See you soon. xxx</P></P><hr size='1'><H2>My kind of town, Chicago is</H2><H3>2007-09-19 to 2007-09-24</H3><P><P>Touchdown at Chicago`s O`Hare airport and we aree given another public transport system to negotiate.&nbsp; Fortunately, due to track repair works that put Englands to shame, crossing Chicago takes a good 3 hours.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>Eventually we find ourselves in the Loyolla universtiy part of the city.&nbsp; Tierd and unable to drink in our hostel we fall into a local bar.&nbsp; Being surrounded by drunk students all pretending to be 21 was fun for a while.&nbsp; Our waitress was lovely and had her friends rustle up the names of a couple of bars in town we might enjoy and some American lads gave us each a free bud-light (something to do with a promotion, but beggars can`t be choosers)</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>With money running out fast and the girls safely home it was time to revert to budget living - fortunately Chicago is a lovley city just to wander round.&nbsp; Massive buildings wherever the eye wanders and friendly locals who will be more then happy to point you in the right direction.&nbsp; One necessary expense was to indulge in one of Chicagos famous deep pan pizzas and it was lovely although i`m suer my life expectancy has been reduced dramatically.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>At night we discovered a free method of getting drunk.&nbsp; Along with our new freinds Mike and Guy we wandered student dorms and gatecrashed the first party we came across.&nbsp; The people were a little wary at first, but the British charm came out and the girls made us feel welcome (the guy`s kept there distance all night - it was a little awkward, vut at least there was no trouble.)</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>With Guy and Mike bing the sort of people who research places, we discovered we could go to the top of the Hankok building and only have to buy a drink (much cheaper than going to the observation deck and a floor higher) and when we got up there the service was so slow we were able to sneak out again.&nbsp; No better price than free.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>Havin managed to get ourselves invited to a costume party the next night we turned up ready for a crazy time, but it turns out all the students are Jesuits and so don`t really drink.&nbsp; That didn`t seem like a reason for us not to however, and so it was a&nbsp;fun night and only a couple of people asked if i knew the Queen.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>Chicago, i can`t remember what i expected but it was a lot better i`m sure.&nbsp; Great people, awesome food and&nbsp;beautiful parks along the lakes.&nbsp; What a skyline!!&nbsp; Let`s hope they get the olympics in 2016!</P></P><hr size='1'><H2>The last Hurrah</H2><H3>2007-09-24 to 2007-10-12</H3><P><P>So, we`re back and have been for some time, but I guess that now I`m at work with nothing to do it would be time to finish this wonderful epic that has been our trip.</p><P>&nbsp;</p><P>After Chicago it was time to increase our carbon footprint just that little bit more with a flight to Boston.&nbsp; The home of the Boston tea party and the basis for the American war of Independence.&nbsp; If you are a proud Brit who doesn`t like hearing about how the Americans got rid of us then Boston is not the place for you.&nbsp; Filled with Independence walks and trails, with stories of horses single handedly ousting the British army, Boston exists only to show American might in all its glory.&nbsp; having said that, our hostel manager liked taking his residents out and was quite happy to pay for tequila and we did get to meet some hard working Harvard students.</p><P>&nbsp;</p><P>Hostel number 2 in Boston was a little more out of town, but we were surrounded with people our own age and lots of cheap vodka (this stuff would certainly freeze!!)&nbsp; So it was&nbsp;with suitable hangovers that&nbsp;we boarded the greyhound to Toronto via Montreal.</p><P>&nbsp;</p><P>Toronto - big tower, baseball team and not a lot else.&nbsp; Met up with Babak, Lloyd and Harry (you may remember them from Queenstown) and had a throughly amusing night on the town, but didn`t really have much to fill our days and the trip to Niagara was far to expensive for the likes of us!!!</p><P>&nbsp;</p><P>Back on the greyhound to D.C (via NYC) where we did our sightseeing duty and took in the sights of Capitol hill, the White House, the Washington memorial and the Lincoln memorial (did you know it`s a federal offense to try to sit on his lap!!)&nbsp; Our hostel was a touch out of town, but spent the night singing along to the sound of a guitar and drinking fine wine and Gorden`s Vodka (i thought they only made Gin and they probably should have stuck to it!!)&nbsp; Duane even tried to sneak into a swimming-pool with predictable results.</p><P>&nbsp;</p><P>So to NYC on the greyhound, staying in Jazz on the park (95th and Amsterdam).&nbsp; The people were cool, we were surrounded with bagel selling deli`s and we had a roof terrace where drinking was actively encouraged.&nbsp; Jumping into Central Park everyday saw to the exercise (Duane even tried running) and we paid visits to the Met museum, the natural history museum and the Rockefeller center.&nbsp; The sights to see in NYC are numerous, but we did as many as possible - Empire state building, Chrysler, Stature of Liberty, Times Square etc and met up with the British boys (Guy and Mike) we met in Chicago - i may have written about them, it`s hard to recall.</p><P>&nbsp;</p><P>NYC, you either love it or hate it and, as my T-shirt will support, i love it.&nbsp; So 9 months done.&nbsp; Lessons learned, experience gained and debt gathered.&nbsp; 2007 will go down as a very good year.................anyone fancy going to South America next year????</p></P><hr size='1'>
