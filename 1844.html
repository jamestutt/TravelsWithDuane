<H1>Diary for Dion and Duane</H1><hr size='1'><H2>The Polish struggle</H2><H3>2007-02-15</H3><P>A midight train to Krakow and a very murkey, grey day.  As we don`t plan to spend much time here we lock up our bags and look into what can be done in this part of the world.  The first issue, they have changed the currency.  Just when i was coming to terms with the Euro they start using the Zolty......damn them!!  The second isue, another European language I don`t speak (although i becoming very good at a vacant experssion).  I have also discovered that the best way to deal with the language barrier is to stand at the border and shout.  Of course they understand, I`m British!!

</P><P>So we hopped on a train to complete our Jewish education at Auschwitz.  A harrowing history in that place and if I had stayed any longer I may have lost all faith in humanity.  Words cannot descibe the feeling of standing in a gas camber where 2000 people were killed at a time and then had their hair and gold teeth stripped before being burnt.  Only one thing could be done.  We found a bar, got sensibly drunk and discussed the inherent evil of Nazism.

</P><P>Time to get a train to Prague (I hear they have some lovely bars and perhaps we can join a British stag party) and so another night was spent on a sleeper tain with the rumble of the tracks lulling us into a deep sleep.

</P><P>As an aside, as soon as I find a computer that will do what I want it to I will upload more photos.  Promise.</P><hr size='1'>
