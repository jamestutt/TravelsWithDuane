</P><P>..Well today is the last day James Duane and myself will hang out. we have travelled a lot together in a three and it has been great. I must say how supportive both of them have been, they have helped me out in many ways. The first time i was so impressed with thier caring attitudes, it was back in Anjuna and we were all walking along to a beach party. It wasn`t miles and miles away but it was quite a trek in the pitch black. Bless their cottons, with their torch they made sure the path way was lkit the whole way there and back so i didn`t fall. Now this may sound very simple, but to me it meant a great deal - helped me a great deal too. 
</P><P>
</P><P>I would also like to bring to your attention that Duane actually slept on the floor of the train and gave me his bed so i wouldn`t have to travel second class, he also shared a bed with a random Indian dude (so i didn`t have too) on a 16hour bus journey,  (phew!). Very kind indeed. 
</P><P>
</P><P>James has been very supportive friend also, he helped me a great deal in Varanessi, stair city! He carried my back pack for me and is always making sure i am ok, waiting for me helping me out, passing my crutches. James often makes sure i am well and all is ok. 
</P><P>
</P><P>But neither of the lads have ever been over the top with their support, they have just stepped in when i have needed the help, it has been grand. And on top of all of that we have had a really good time together, the three of us work well as a team. Duane and I bicker sometimes, ha ha (strong personalities) but really we know it is in jest, very childlike in ways :o) And James and i have star gazed many a time(has a degree in astronomy which i think is cool), talked about life religion and logic, and he has talked about the moon and the stars ect - we have all ...[editor`s privilage]... together, got drunk, swam in the sea, shared the same bed, visited Taj mahul togehter, watch octopussy, saw bodies being burnt - all od this in three to four weeks -  we have done many great things and i shall miss them both as of today. It has been such a pleasure hanging out with both of them, they are both very ambicious and i believe each of them will be great successful people, they are half way there already.
