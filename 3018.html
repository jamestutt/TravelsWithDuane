<H1>Diary for Dion and Duane</H1><hr size='1'><H2>The last Hurrah</H2><H3>2007-09-24 to 2007-10-12</H3><P><P>So, we`re back and have been for some time, but I guess that now I`m at work with nothing to do it would be time to finish this wonderful epic that has been our trip.</p><P>&nbsp;</p><P>After Chicago it was time to increase our carbon footprint just that little bit more with a flight to Boston.&nbsp; The home of the Boston tea party and the basis for the American war of Independence.&nbsp; If you are a proud Brit who doesn`t like hearing about how the Americans got rid of us then Boston is not the place for you.&nbsp; Filled with Independence walks and trails, with stories of horses single handedly ousting the British army, Boston exists only to show American might in all its glory.&nbsp; having said that, our hostel manager liked taking his residents out and was quite happy to pay for tequila and we did get to meet some hard working Harvard students.</p><P>&nbsp;</p><P>Hostel number 2 in Boston was a little more out of town, but we were surrounded with people our own age and lots of cheap vodka (this stuff would certainly freeze!!)&nbsp; So it was&nbsp;with suitable hangovers that&nbsp;we boarded the greyhound to Toronto via Montreal.</p><P>&nbsp;</p><P>Toronto - big tower, baseball team and not a lot else.&nbsp; Met up with Babak, Lloyd and Harry (you may remember them from Queenstown) and had a throughly amusing night on the town, but didn`t really have much to fill our days and the trip to Niagara was far to expensive for the likes of us!!!</p><P>&nbsp;</p><P>Back on the greyhound to D.C (via NYC) where we did our sightseeing duty and took in the sights of Capitol hill, the White House, the Washington memorial and the Lincoln memorial (did you know it`s a federal offense to try to sit on his lap!!)&nbsp; Our hostel was a touch out of town, but spent the night singing along to the sound of a guitar and drinking fine wine and Gorden`s Vodka (i thought they only made Gin and they probably should have stuck to it!!)&nbsp; Duane even tried to sneak into a swimming-pool with predictable results.</p><P>&nbsp;</p><P>So to NYC on the greyhound, staying in Jazz on the park (95th and Amsterdam).&nbsp; The people were cool, we were surrounded with bagel selling deli`s and we had a roof terrace where drinking was actively encouraged.&nbsp; Jumping into Central Park everyday saw to the exercise (Duane even tried running) and we paid visits to the Met museum, the natural history museum and the Rockefeller center.&nbsp; The sights to see in NYC are numerous, but we did as many as possible - Empire state building, Chrysler, Stature of Liberty, Times Square etc and met up with the British boys (Guy and Mike) we met in Chicago - i may have written about them, it`s hard to recall.</p><P>&nbsp;</p><P>NYC, you either love it or hate it and, as my T-shirt will support, i love it.&nbsp; So 9 months done.&nbsp; Lessons learned, experience gained and debt gathered.&nbsp; 2007 will go down as a very good year.................anyone fancy going to South America next year????</p></P><hr size='1'>
