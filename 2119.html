<H1>Diary for Dion and Duane</H1><hr size='1'><H2>Udaipur: The Maharana and Octopussy.</H2><H3>2007-04-10 to 2007-04-13</H3><P>As the sun rose over lake Pochala we arrived in Udaipur. The Maharanas of Mewar claim to have been the longest unbroken dynasty in the world. Descended from the sun the Maharanas have held the throne for 76 generation and the palaces of Udaipur do much to suggest this long and proud history. A history that was only ended 35 years ago when Indra Ghandi stripped the Idian princes of the titles and privileges. The star in the cities crown is the famous lake palace that majestically floats in the middle of Pochala. There is little to do but relax and enjoy the wonderful vistas. We met Damelza (again) shortly after we arrived and a hole host of other nationalities staying in the most charming Lal Ghat guest house - and old house sitting on the edge of the lake. Most days we would either sit in the courtyard  or on the balconies bettering ourselves through reading or debate. The city palace was wortha trip though so we rallied a posse of travellers and picking up a very enthusiastic guide we wondered around the history of the city. Now the other reason to come to Udaipur is, of course, that it was in this city that Rodger Moore brought James Bond and Octopusssy together. If you were unaware of this before you arrived you would not be able to remain so for long. Udaipur is the only place in the world that i`m aware of where you can walk into any bar at any time, rquest to watch Octopussy and the staff will be more than more than happy to oblige.Every rooftop retaurant and bar nightly shows the film so you can sit and keep one eye on the movie and one eye on the locations at which it was filmed. We watched it twice. Of course the Maharana had and has (he now lives in a wing of the city palace off the revenue from his other palaces whih have all become 5* hotels) a splendid collection of vintage European and American cars. And of course his Rolls Royce phantom II had a cameo in the Bond film. So we paid our Rs 100 and two envious boys were led around the garages. The final palace to visit in Udaipur is the Monsoon palace. Perched on top of a hill it hangs over the city and offers the most incredible views of the surrounding area. Inspired by 007, we raced up the winding mountain pass, girls vs boys in two struggling tuc-tucs. The boys won, naturally, after the girl`s steed overheated and they had wasted their water throwing it over the boys in a moment of competative arrogance. But at the top all jibes were silenced by the majesty of the setting sun. built by a line of princes that claim the sun as their ancestor the monsoon palace resembled a temple to the setting sun in which the light seemed to be honoured and commanded the utmost respect and tranquillity. The jorney home was quiet and peaceful. We stayed in Udaipur longer than we anticipated and we would not have left for much longer if our flight to Hanoi did not loom on the horizon. The city and company was perfect.</P><hr size='1'>
