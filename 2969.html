<H1>Diary for Dion and Duane</H1><hr size='1'><H2>Ski School; On the Piste (apologies for the pun).</H2><H3>2007-08-15 to 2007-08-18</H3><P>Well we arrived back in Queenstown and sat aroung in our shorts while we washed all our clothes - this illustrating the down side of living out of a van - and an early night was called for since the bell was sent for 06:30. The bus picked us up the next morning at 07:30 and we headed up to The Remarkables. Kitted out we headed of to our first lesson I opted for the ab initio class and Dion headed off somewhere else. It turns out that I`m naturally a very good skier perfectly performing pizzas and parallel turns in the snow, whilst not forgeting to lob the odd snowball at my class mates. This fun, early nights and earlier morning lasted for three days by which time my legs were jelly and my snow plows were sloppy so I removed my skis and walked down the piste to head back to Queenstown.

</P><P>Right no sensible period of time, during any holiday, should be spent away from the hard liquor and after three days of responsible sleeping we were cutting it fine. Fortunately Queenstown expects this and so armed with discount vouchers and the promise of free shoys of this and that we marched in to town. A dink here, a drink there a teapot and a Jaegerbomb chaser is a fine way to start an evening off and taging along with our old room mates we ploughed on into the night.

</P><P>The next day we had to move hostels, but on the recomendation of the boys who Jaeger-carpet-bombed us the night before this involved driving 100m down the road. After much lying in front of the TV night arrived again and the same band of merry revellers once more headed out. A few quiet pints and an early night soon turned into enough Jaegermeister to slay a herd of wolly mamoths and another early morning trip to Winnie`s to dance off any remaining dignity.</P><hr size='1'>
