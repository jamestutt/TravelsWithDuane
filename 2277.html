<H1>Diary for Dion and Duane</H1><hr size='1'><H2>Hue</H2><H3>2007-04-25 to 2007-04-27</H3><P>Dion, Duane, Freddy and Glen arrived in Hue early in the morning and tired. They took the cheapest hotel that was on offer from the guys that met them at the bus stop and having dropped off their stuff brteakfasted on scrambled eggs and bacon washed down with lashings of iced coffee. They decided to hire bikes for the day and get out of the city and so after a while they were cruising down the streets of the city heading out towards the lush green countryside and the mountains beyond. With the wind in their hair and nothing but adventure in front of them hastle bothered them from no direction. Riding along the Perfume river they pulled up outside a Pagoda that had been recomended to them as on of the oldest ones in the city. They decided that it was a lovely pagoda and set off again. After returning to the city for a lunch (or two, for the German) they headed south towards a monestry. The Zen monks were very welcoming and the boys spoke for hours refining their knowledge of the finer theologies of Buddism and watched the younger monks play and agressive game of football. Tired, yet enlightened Dion and Duane road back to the hotel leaving Freddy talking to the monks and Glen headed out into the hills. That evening they found Thu. "Me love you long time", she called as they wondered wondering about dinner. "lovely gubbley. Happy Hour". Sold. They spent the night and a bottle of Rum in Thu`s "Cafe on Thu Wheels" and never has a single bar maid provided so much entertainment for her punters. Wheather creating a Sweedish birthday cake or playing games involving bottles and biros she entertained the lads while merrily peddling tours of the city. "I shall have to recomend this place to anyone I know comming this way", thought the boys. The next day our four heroes went on a tour of the DMZ. Highlights included Khe Sahn air base and the tunnels at Vin Moc on the north Viet Nam side of the 17th Parallel. At this point your humble narrator is at a loss. Although logically our fantastic four must have done something that evening what this may have been was unfortunately lost to our little history but for continuity assume that were with Thu again (as is more than likely the case anyway). The next day was hot and so a postcard was written to a Mr D. Rusbrige of London, England while the afternon was spent strolling about another palace. This activity led to a lengthy debate about what the term "forbiden city" means literally and in recomending the palace to future adventurers your narrator remembers only the debate and not the palace. Dinner, Beer then an early bus for the quartet to Hoi An the next morning.</P><hr size='1'>
