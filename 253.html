<H1>Diary for Dion and Duane</H1><hr size='1'><H2>.........flowers in your hair!!</H2><H3>2007-09-03 to 2007-09-07</H3><P>After enough of the manufactured, beautiful people vibe of LA we headed off to Sna Francisco upon our air-conditioned shuttle bus provided by the hostel.  The only issue was that the air-con hadn`t been turned on - you have no idea how hot it was.  India and SE Asia were not a patch on it.
</P><P>
</P><P>So, finally, we arrived in Frisco and immediately had a good feel for the place.  More grubby and down to earth than the sprawling mess of LA and most importantly it meant the 3rd meeting between us and Alison and Gemma (for those who need a little refresh - we met in Vietnam, traveled into Cambodia and met again in NZ)
</P><P>
</P><P>For the first time in ages our time was planned for us.  We didn`t have a timetable (we would only have lost them), but the girls made sure we saw all San Fran had to offer in the time we had.  We visited the Rock, the Golden Gate Bridge, had a meal in little Italy, went out drinking and even visited the Mission which has a reputation and so the girls wanted to wait until some protection came.  In the end they had to make do with me and Duane.
</P><P>
</P><P>We must have done something right though, as the girls extended their holiday by 2 weeks, hired a car with us and we plan to head south to San Diego, into the desert to see a meteorite crater (yes i am a geek!) and off to Vegas.  Let the good times roll.
</P><P>
</P><P>For all those who care.............we may even pop into Orange County!  If you want any messages passed on, please let me know!</P><hr size='1'>
