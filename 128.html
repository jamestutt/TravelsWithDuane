      <span class="MyContentHeadline">Goa I: Anjuna.</span><br><br>
      We arrived in Goa early in the morning where we were ushered off the train by a obstreperous Italian/Goan Lady who insisted that we should share a taxi to Anjuna with her and a South African/Goan Lady ... and their delightful children. 
<br>
<br>And so we arrived at our accomodation tired, hot and exceptionaly infanticidal. The place however was more than we could have hoped for. Anjuna Palms guest house is composed of a hamlet of five rooms in the back garden of a family house. The family - Dena, Felix and Caleb - went out of their way to ensure that we had everything we could want. We were even cooked a Goan shell curry for breakfast one morning to our delight. 
<br>
<br>So having forgotten the stress and hectic atmosphere of the city we all too easily relaxed into the Goan way of life. 
<br>
<br>Anjuna has taken its toll on time too. The chilled out vibe seems to have retarded temporal progression so that nothing seems to have changed since the coming of the Hippies in the late 60s. One wonders down the street past long, grey haired, leathery, golden brown, old flower children driving around topless on 125cc Enfields. It was at this point that we decided to get a bike. Dena (our hostess) made a quick phone call and within seconds we were the proud owners of a fierce motorbike. We took it for a spin...
<br>
<br>It is hard to say for how many hours or days we had lain in the dust and bubbling tarmac after the crash but thirteen vulturs were circuling our blooded location and 12 rabid dogs were sparring nearby for the possession of our mortal remains. The road was empty and our location was unkown to me. We could have travelled for hundreds of miles on the bike before we were vanquished. I suspected that i had broken every bone in my entire body with the exception of a femur, a tibia and my mallei, incudes and stapedes, though i was getting most pain from my wrist and foot. I had to make a run for it. Collecting together as much of my spilt blood as i could i hoisted myself onto my one semi-intact limb and throwing a groaning Dion over one shoulder and the mangled motorcycle over the other i started the slow and agonising treck back to our first aid kit. For days and days the baking sun oppressed and frustrated this lonely journey but for days and days i pressed forward the best i could untill once more i collapsed in the dust and the light receeded from my eyes. The dreams and deliria that go through ones head in such a state are unutterable but from them once again i awoke. This time i found myself hanging from a resurected Dion and in sight of home. The Heroic traveller had come to during my unconciousness and dragged our bloody corpses back to Anjuna. Whereat we used half a first aid kit to patch ourselves back together. 
<br>
<br>There is a bar in Anjuna called the Sea Queen which shows two (pirated) films nightly in the garden while you eat, drink and be merry. This is were, that night, we met Bryan, a Canadian, who will now take up the narrative, since he was attentive and was, "always listening carefully for a conversation in English. Which is how I started meeting Brits (Brits speaking English, shocking!), and eventually a couple of guys named Dionne [sic.](or James according to every piece of ID he has on him) and Duane. Now I don't know whether it was because these guys were former Manchester-ites, whether they had just survived a 'minor' scooter accident that day (only to survive another one the following day), or because we watched all of 'Love Actually' together (huge Hugh Grant fans, those guys), whatever it was, we seemed to put up with each other. We spent the next few days burning on the beach then the two of them crashing the scooter in the evening before meeting up for a movie during dinner. It was a lot of fun, especially since they were the ones showing up every night with new cuts, limps, and bruises, it seemed we always had something to talk about. Final night in Goa, we're doing more of the same, sans scooter crashing, when we meet a couple of Swedish girls who were all types of Swedish, fitting almost every stereotype I knew, who apparently had been background bikini beach blondes (alliteration? No....onomatopoeia? No.....it is one of those words you learn in English Lit. classes.....blame the education system) in a Bollywood film in Mumbai. We go out for drinks with them. Once pass formalities, names, where you're from, the third subject was (cover the ears Grandma) sex. Now I'm looking down at the table and I count one drink, and I barely touched it. Maybe I have limited experience in this but usually we're a bit short of drinks for sex talk and usually the guy has to do a long, drawn out mind-game before a girl even utters the word. I think even the Brits were a little surprised......Why didn't I visit Sweden? After getting fairly inebriated until well passed 3 in the morning, I stumbled home and pretty much blinked before being woken up by a pounding on the door by my taxi driver".
<br> 
<br>Bryan Left after a couple of days and the sweedes followed suit. But in the void left by his absense the love generation was formed...<br/><br/><table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td nowrap><b>Next:&nbsp;</b></td><td><a href=127.html>The fondest memories to cling on to are the hardest ones to keep.</a></td></tr><tr><td nowrap><b>Previous:&nbsp;</b></td><td><a href=129.html>The gateway to India</a></td></tr></table><br>
