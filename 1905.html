<H1>Diary for Dion and Duane</H1><hr size='1'><H2>Oh Vienna...........(it means nothing to me!)</H2><H3>2007-02-17 to 2007-02-18</H3><P>Never enter Vienna without a clear plan of where you are going and how to get there.  They don`t have the usual abundance of English speakers at the train stations trying to flog you hostels and so the leg work has to be done yourself (and can be one of the most de-motivating experiences of your life). 
</P><P>
</P><P>Having found a hostel and experienced the tram (never really figured out how to pay so I presume public transport in Austria is free!!) we decided to head out for a beer.  Nothing to severe as we have to go to church tomorrow and it will certainly be nice to wake up without a hangover. 
</P><P>
</P><P>An early start and off to church at the Hofburg palace.  The service is in the Hofmusikkapelle and is conducted in German and Latin (no hope for me there then).  Off to have a coffee and then we decide to improve our Austrian history at the Wein Muzeum (no mention of the world wars, which was odd). 
</P><P>
</P><P>As it was a beautiful winters day we decided to walk along the park to the cemetary where Alumni such as Beethoven, Shubert, Mozart and Hayden are buried.  Having got a cheap map from the station upon arrival we decided to believe the scale.  A MISTAKE.  Due to this we ended up in the middle of a park, miles away from any means of transport and so the only thing to do was carry on (it wouldn`t be right, admitting defeat in Austria).  22 Km walk later and another free train ride we were back at our hostel planning to head to Munich. 
</P><P>
</P><P>Vienna, a beautiful city and a good place to retire too.  My soul feels thoroughly cleansed.</P><hr size='1'>
