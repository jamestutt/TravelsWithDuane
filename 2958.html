<H1>Diary for Dion and Duane</H1><hr size='1'><H2>The end days!</H2><H3>2007-08-26 to 2007-08-30</H3><P>With time in NZ drawing to a close it was time to assess what there was left to do.  One more LOTR film and an epic voyage from Wellington to Christchurch.  So we stumbled onto Upper Hutt - described as the dormitory of Wellington - and were put up by Tabitha and Chris.  While they went off to school we became aquainted with Upper Hutt (it didn`t take long) and NZ TV.  With Duane`s replacement passport ready and nothing stopping us now we set off to Auckland.

</P><P>Little to say about the trip.  Charged MP3 players more than made up for the lack of a working radio and we made it to Auckland without drama and even found the hotel with no trouble at all (stuff like this never happens).
</P><P>
</P><P>We gave back the car - a sad day!  We wandered around Auckland, replenished our depleted reading stock (i have decided to take on some classical literature - complete and unabridged!)  and prepared to cross the date line, travel back in time and take on American customs.  Wish us luck!</P><hr size='1'>
