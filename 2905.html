<H1>Diary for Dion and Duane</H1><hr size='1'><H2>The South of the South</H2><H3>2007-08-07 to 2007-08-14</H3><P>We headed out from Christchurch full of petrol and raring to go, with dreams and aspirations of climbing the infamous Mount Cook and taking in the sights and beauty of as many of the LOTR locations that we could possibly find.  With time on our side, we parked up in Lake Tekapo, tried to cook a meal on a camping stove and tested out the camper van...........woke up a little sore, but i`m sure it just takes a bit of getting used to.
</P><P>
</P><P>It seems Mount Cook is one oif the toughest climbs in the world and so we satisfied oursslves with a walk to the base of the Hooker glacier which runs down Mount Cook and headed to Queenstown.  This was a fact-finding mission.  We booked skiing, watched people trwon themselves off bridges and headed off in the direction of Milford sounds (que the rain).
</P><P>
</P><P>The rain didn`t close the road or cause any avalanches (hence why i can keep you updated!) but it did ruin the view of Milford sounds and cause many unseen waterfalls to errupt from the surrounding hills (evey cloud has a silver lining).
</P><P>
</P><P>Time to head around the coastal highway to visit some of the more random and small settlements in NZ.  The largest town in Catlins had 300 odd residents (massive!), but the scenery was beautiful, the campsites were cheap and we are developing a close relationship with our van!
</P><P>
</P><P>Road to Dunedin to attempt to see Albatrosses (you had to pay so we didn`t!), elephant seals (an uncomfirmed sighting) and spherical boulders (they don`t move so a big tick for that one!!!)  We then took a meandering road back towards Queenstown and stayed in what was probably once a prison in Alexander (the town that only has one claim to fame - a massive clock on the hill.  Very usful for tewlling the time, but terribly random!)
</P><P>
</P><P>So, we find ourselves back in Queenstown and, against my mothers good advice, i have thrown myself off a 43m high bridge and lived to tell the tale.  Tomorrow skiing begins and our thoughts have to turn to our expedition north!</P><hr size='1'>
