<H1>Diary for Dion and Duane</H1><hr size='1'><H2>Christchurch, NZ.</H2><H3>2007-08-02 to 2007-08-07</H3><P>Arriving in Australia was like coming home to an England that seemed quite familiar at first but revealed its perculiarities once the jet-lag had abaited. Arriving in New Zealand was like coming home to England but with fush and chups. Christchurch, described as the most English city in the southern hemisphere, reminded me of a city produced from the mixing of 14th century Oxford and contemporary Slough. Walking down Cambridge St. and Glouster St. to the botanic gardens one found, not Gum trees and Eucalyptus, but trees that would not look out of place in a park in Derbyshire. The birds sang English tunes and a man wearing a boater could even be hired to punt you down the river Avon. The choice of English pubs serving English food with English ales next to log fires was a little disconcerting at first but we soon found our feet. The only place that indicated that we were indeed not being rained on in the UK was the museum in which the exhibits of Maori history and Antarctic expeditions reaffirmed our 43 degrees south. Gemma and Alison, whom we had left in Siem Reap, Cambodia after a long day wondering around Angkor, arrived on the sunday and so the company was terrifically assembled to endulge our anglophilic appetites. After picking up a camper van for a month we took a day trip to the delightful Banks peninsula for fush and chups by the sea before once again parting company with a few English pints in a few English pubs and a promise to meet up in San Fransisco. See you there girls!</P><hr size='1'>
