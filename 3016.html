<H1>Diary for Dion and Duane</H1><hr size='1'><H2>Road Trip: we`ve been having fun, driving in the sun.</H2><H3>2007-09-07 to 2007-09-19</H3><P><P>In the words of Gemma and Alison:&nbsp; "So with `Hotel California` blasting out of the stereo we took to the&nbsp;road to travel the famous&nbsp;Highway 1 coastal route bound for San Diego.&nbsp;&nbsp;With stops in Santa Cruz, Cambria,&nbsp;and even `The OC` itself - Newport Beach - we had an amazing few days&nbsp;and a great start to our `extended adventure.`&nbsp;[unable to say goodbye the girls had to extend their trip by two weeks].&nbsp;There was a slight hiccup in Santa Barbara when&nbsp;Dion kept navigating us into a car park that `wasn`t there`. </P><P>Back on the road, after the slight delay we moved onwards to San Diego with spectacular scenery all the way.&nbsp; The Californian coast is stunning - rivalling New Zealand in its rugged beauty and surpassing it in that it wasn`t so damn cold when we stopped to take photographs!</P><P>We stopped in San Diego for a couple of nights which gave us all the chance to indulge in some&nbsp;fantastic spanish-inspired &nbsp;cuisine &nbsp;(paella and sangria - yum!) [this was where my Margarita binge began] and more importantly gave Alison the opportunity&nbsp;for her long-awaited&nbsp;visit to San Diego`s famous&nbsp;Zoo.&nbsp; Thank god for Dion&nbsp;accompanying her and allowing Duane and I to chill out in the animal-free park instead! [Amen to that, cheers mate].</P><P>An epic drive&nbsp;across the border to Arizona was next on the trip and after&nbsp;8 hours of travelling (with only 3 CD`s we were already tiring of to choose&nbsp;between!) [and the girls skipping all the good tracks] we finally arrived in Flagstaff, gateway to the Grand Canyon.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our day at the Canyon was&nbsp;absolutely incredible.&nbsp; None of us really had any idea what&nbsp;to expect of this&nbsp;immense natural wonder but it`s safe to say that we were&nbsp;all pretty much blown away on first sight.&nbsp; We spent the day&nbsp;in the national park picnicking with the squirrels whilst looking over the Canyon (shame about the view hey Duane?!) and then headed back for a chilled out evening.</P><P>The next day was spent in `Dion`s world` with a visit to the Meteor Crater in the middle of the&nbsp;desert. &nbsp;&nbsp;At first neither&nbsp;Alison or myself thought we would be&nbsp;particulary impressed by a big hole in the ground (even if it was created&nbsp;by something from outer space!) but&nbsp;having our personal physics-buff with us meant that the whole&nbsp;visit was so much more interesting.&nbsp;[No one heard Dion complain about having to spend a day looking at fluffy animals in a zoo]</P><P>After&nbsp;a quick stop at the Hoover Dam we crossed into our third state and travelled across the cacti-covered Nevada desert heading for Vegas Baby! We&nbsp;hit Las Vegas Boulevard&nbsp;with music blaring,&nbsp;hanging out of the windows with our cameras ready to snap as many pics as possible of the casinos, hotels and general&nbsp;neon-lit craziness of `the Strip`&nbsp;</P><P>Our fantastic hostel - complete with pool and hot-tub! - was the scene of&nbsp;a drunken first evening`s frolics and a first day`s recovery before we pulled ourselves together, dressed ourselves up and hit the Venetian hotel and casino for a fabulous dinner (thank god for credit cards!)&nbsp; An undoubted&nbsp;highlight of the evening was the 45 minutes we spent watching the fountains outside of the Bellagio (there`s a show every 15 minutes and we&nbsp;stayed&nbsp;for 3 of them - Viva Las Vegas!)&nbsp;[not to mention the yard long Margaritas]</P><P>So having gone out with a bang in&nbsp;Vegas, our&nbsp;last night&nbsp;of what was an amazing road trip was spent in Yosemite national park, relaxing with a delicious dinner and sleeping in log cabins before rising early for our drive&nbsp;back to San Francisco and our last night of our travels."</P><P>Cheers girls (and I don`t just mean for writting my blog for me) it was an excellent adventure in the desert. Gemma your watch is still ticking and I`ve not worn it in the shower yet. See you soon. xxx</P></P><hr size='1'>
