<H1>Diary for Dion and Duane</H1><hr size='1'><H2>The fondest memories to cling on to are the hardest ones to keep.</H2><H3>2007-03-17 to 2007-03-22</H3><P>It was Demelza`a birthday. Demelza is from Brighton and was staying across the garden from us. Lucas (Aussie) and Anti (Fin) live next door to us (this is the poor man`s side of the garden.) We had been to the beach a couple of times with Lucas and Anti and had exchanged pleasantries, chatted about cricket and had even been to see Pulp Fiction ... so we got on quit well. As i said it was Demelza`s birthday. It is hard to explain how intense brief inter-traveler friendships can be. The closest parallel would probably be fresher`s week when you find yourself friends with everyone (apologies for those who have never been to university - perhaps it would be like your first week at work: I don`t know). So... it was Demelza`s birthday and so everyone was the best of friends. We went out to Ingo`s Saturday night market - it`s a hippy affair. Like the Wednesday Flea market only at night, on a Saturday and with beer and live music (sitars; bongos; didgeridoos - you get the set up!). The food is particularly good here too! We drank, laughed, larked while watching the array of musical talent, hypnotists and Japaneses fire dancers. After the live entertainment we meandered through the stalls to the dance floor (centered round a tree - as most things are). Here we strutted our stuff before the latest Goan trance before tumbling back into our garden and divulging in turn our life stories and singing "Feel the Love Generation". We had booked three night at the Anjuna Palms guest house and left a week later than our first extension. It`s hard to say how we spent the time because really we didn`t do that much. We got up late. Went to Munchies (next door) for breakfast. Read. Went to the beach. Had dinner. Watched a film (or two) at the Sea Queen. Watched the cricket at Eatopia. Fell into bed about 3am. It was because of this well structured nothingness that one night we decided do something: to have a beach party. Our beach bar was called Lilliput. On the Monday evening (I couldn`t tell you which Monday but the flyer had informed me that it was a Monday) there was a show case of local musical talent at Lilliput (local as in Americans, Canadians, Australians etc.) There were fire works on the beach (literally), and an auditorium on the sand. The bands were excellent and when they had finished i heard cries for more. We went into the bar where Dion very graciously and with the best of intentions lost a game of pool to an angry Irishman who appeared slightly unhinged while i chatted away in my own form of perfect German to a lady from Salzburg. Oh how we danced that night. I`m not sure who first suggested the skinny dipping but there really is no feeling like floating in a warm sea in the dark, naked, under the stars (Demelza abstained - as girls will). If you lie on the beach looking at the stars you can pretend that you are hanging from the beach and that it would be possible to fall onto the stars below (Henry - I`ve been told that you are a champion of this game) and so we wiled away a couple more hours in this fashion. You need an astro-physicist to really get the most out of this game - luckily we had one. I don`t remember getting to bed - probably on account of the feni (the local firewater) - but a truly successful party. One thing i did discover in Anjuna: a wonderful way to cope with a hangover is to spend the day floating in a warm sea. There is little more to say. Everyday was as excellent as the one before though i couldn`t tell you what i did. And it took a very long time to pluck up the motivation to leave. On Thursday the 22nd of March we finally managed to move three hours down the coast to Palolem. Damelza came with us.</P><hr size='1'>
