<H1>Diary for Dion and Duane</H1><hr size='1'><H2>a review of the antics of the famous travelling duo, Duane & Dion, on the Thai mainland.</H2><H3>2007-06-08 to 2007-06-12</H3><P>Well since Dion is these days always at least 18 metres below sea level I have taken it upon myself, yes sans encouragement, to bring chaps and chapettes at home up to date (again). We finally left Laos, Freddy, Rob and the less civilised world far (3 days by boat) behind us and arrived in Chang Mai at around the time that we in this part of the world like to think it appropriate to start drinking. Since Wikitravel had nothing extrordinary to say about Thailands northern metropolis apart from providing a long list of bars we decidied to look around and to our surprise we found a lot of bars. Having beat some locals at Jenga and thus procured some nasty shots of vodka we finaly settleded upon patronising an English ex-pat with a juke box full of old Manchester tunes. Dragging a meagre tail eager English adventurers behind him our braumeister closed his bar and led us to another where he could also enjoy the national pass time. Having exhausted what Chang Mai had to offer the next day we bought a train ticket for an evening departure to Bangkok. This left us with a whole day to experience the coffee shops. This done we caught our train and headed south.

</P><P>Arrival in Bangkok was at 6:30 in the morning and as i had securred accomodation with a lethargic cousin it seemed an inappropriate time to check in. So after much impossibility trying to explain to the taxi guys taht we did not need a hotel we went to the post office to send some unecessaries back to Blighty. Then Breakfast and Dion encouraging local girls to do his sewing for him and by now it was mid-day so we sky-trained it to our accomodation. After the usual catch-up converstaions and cups of tea between relatives who have not seem each other for a while Dion and I left my cousin to do some work and went to starbucks for the afternoon - the first place we could find with air-con. That evening my cousin`s hospitality knew no bounds as we were toured all the night spots of that famous capital starting in a huge indoor / out door night market with gallons of beer and the biggest kareoke stage i have ever had the pleasure (?) to be audience to. The next day we headed to the Khao San road to get back with our own and find a bus to the deep south. This been done we wondered to the King`s palace and arrived back at my cousins house in time for dinner and some last night drinks. This time we opted for a small Thai beer garden accross the road where white peole were very welcome as the stuff of myth and legend, never before beheld. The next day after a late breakfast we sky-trained back to Khao San to while away the few hour we had left in Bangkok. That evening we were on a bus headed for Koh Pha Ngan.</P><hr size='1'>
