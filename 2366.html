<H1>Diary for Dion and Duane</H1><hr size='1'><H2>Cambodia</H2><H3>2007-05-15 to 2007-05-23</H3><P>So with one country recoving from war behind us we head into another.  After disembarking from our boat we got the mini-bus into Phnom Penh and chose our hostel out from a plethora found by the lakeside.  The lake, a dark expanse of water by that time of night, could be seen from our balcony and so we took our place at one of the many bars lining its side and spent the night enjoying Angkor beer from draft (Cambodia`s finest) and putting the world to right.
</P><P>
</P><P>After so much traveling over the past few days, it called for a late start and a lazy day reading books, lying in hammocks and supping on beer whilst looking over the, suprisingly, lush and green lake.  The day past without event and so plans could be hatched to go and see the sights of Phnom Penh the following day.  This involved watching "the killing fields" to catch up on Cambodian history.
</P><P>
</P><P>The actual killing fields were a dark and harrowing place.  Coming face-to-face with thousands of human skulls is something you can`t really prepare yourself for.  S21 was no improvement.  It was the prison people were kept in, tortured and put to death with a brutality you could easily compare to the Nazi`s.
</P><P>
</P><P>A day of rest was needed to recover before we headed north to Siem Reap.  Everyone has heard of the temples so we decided to see what else the city had to offer.  A stroll around the old market killed some time and brought much amusement and the evening was filled wih the FA cup final (comiserations to Man U fans).
</P><P>
</P><P>So Angkor Wat - it all began with a sunset from Phnom Bakheng (along with every other tourist in Siem Reap) which was spectacular and well worth the time.  Early to bed and up before dawn to watch the sun reise over Angkor Wat - undescribable!!!!!  After sunrise and a well deserved breakfast myself, Duane, Gemma and Alison (the girls were hard to shake off ;) ) we went into Angkor Thom and saw the marvel of the Bayon, the terrace of the elephants,  the terrace of the lepar king and Phimeanakas.  By this point the heat was unbarable, but we battled on.  We visited Preah Khan (my favourite temple) and Ta Prohm before heading back to Angkor Wat.  This was enough for us and we headed back to Siem Reap for some well deserved rest.
</P><P>
</P><P>Time to think about leaving Cambodia (and the girls) and not wanting to go back to Phnom Penh meant we had to head to Kampong Cham (a little north of the capital).  It is a delightful French colonialistic town with nothing to do in it and so we got some money from the bank (SE Asia doesn`t believe in ATM`s), found a friendly English owned bar and drank Guinness.  The next day we headed north again to Stung Treng (the border crossing town and so lots of people in transit).  We had run out of cash, had no means of getting it and so started getting things on tick from our tour company and eventually Mr. Mo.  Absolutely nothing to do in Stung Treng and so we booked our journey to Don Dat on the 4000 islands just inside Laos, went to bed (we think the room next door was a brothel) and got ready for another border crossing.
</P><P>
</P><P>Lots of history and emotion in Cambodia and i don`t think we had the time to do it justice, but we have heard Laos is all fun and games so the next week or so should be interesting!</P><hr size='1'>
