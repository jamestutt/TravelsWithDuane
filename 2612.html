<H1>Diary for Dion and Duane</H1><hr size='1'><H2>A whole lot of sand!</H2><H3>2007-07-03 to 2007-07-08</H3><P>The time finally came when the comforts of Brisbane had to be given up and we had to make progress north.  Booked on a greyhound bus (too poor for the Oz experience) we headed off to Hervey Bay to experience what it is like by the seaside.  We checked into a cheap, lovely, but empty hostel and planned our trip over to Fraiser.

</P><P>There isn`t much to do in Hervey bay and so the next day was spenting milling around on the beacha nd then watching Transformers (a little bit disappointed with it to be honest!).  Our Fraiser island experience was with a tour - partly beacuse Duane still doesn`t trust me as a driver, but mostly because we didn`t have enough people to make a self driver cost effective.  Had a great time swimming in cold lakes and walking across large expances of sand with the Hump back whales visible just off the shore.  The night spent in the hotel was passed in drinking games and a cross-dressing theme night in the local bar with people i have never learnt the names of.  The french guy had a habit of remembering peoples countries, not names and so the people became France, Poland, Switzerland, Sweeden and Mexico (if any of you are reading this then "Hi!"
</P><P>
</P><P>Back to Hervey bay for a BBQ (couldn`t be in Australia long without one) and to sort out our next bus north.  Had to find a way to get to Kroombit ranch - not and easy goal, but for experienced travellers like ourselves anything is possible.......</P><hr size='1'>
