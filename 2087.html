<H1>Diary for Dion and Duane</H1><hr size='1'><H2>Preparing for the worst</H2><H3>2007-04-08 to 2007-04-09</H3><P>Everyone that we have met in India, without fail, has said that if you are not bothered about going to see the Taj Mahal then stay out of Agra, it`s a dive.  Well being interested in the finer points of architecture (and it`s always nice to say you`ve been somewhere famous), myself, Duane and Demelza arrived in Arga and we picked up by an overfriendly rickshaw driver who didn`t seem that keen on watching the road, not with all this excitment going on behind him.  After settling into our standard hotel room (3 in a bed, it`s the cheap way to do things!) we headed off to the Agra fort. 
</P><P>
</P><P>We decided to get a guide as the bloke was incredibly enthusiastic and actually really good fun to be around.  We were told of the history of the fort; lots of Marharaja with complicated names and lots of illegitimate wives.  With views over the river to the Taj Mahal, we decided it was high time that we headed off to see the most famous piece of Indian architecture and, apparently, one of the seven wonders of the mordern world. 
</P><P>
</P><P>Staggeringly beautiful, perfectly symmetrical and surrounded by tourists - it didn`t disappoint.  Had many an Indian family ask me to have their photo taken with their children and really suprised an American couple when I answered their question in perfect English (yes, some people outside America speak English too!).
</P><P>
</P><P>Off to a nearby rooftop for a drink and to gaze at the Taj Mahal as the sunset.  No sunset was seen; however, as clouds came rolling in and we were treated to a fierce electrical storm with the lightning illuminating all things for miles.  Time to find a bar, watch England lose at the cricket and put the world to rights.
</P><P>
</P><P>Next day and early start and a second class train journey to Delhi, so after a shower, we headed off to the station.  A suprisingly enjoyable train journey mixing with the locals and talking about their passion - cricket.
</P><P>
</P><P>We don`t have long in Delhi as we have plans to get a night train to Udaipur and so after spending some time on our favourite street (the Main Bazaar) we catch our tain and get some well deserved shut-eye.  The moral to this story is that all the people we met were wrong, I wouldn`t go back to Agra, but I am delighted to have seen it.</P><hr size='1'>
