Here you will find coffee in tea bags, winter in summer and the locals enjoying the few days of rain that June provides for the whole year. Here we arrived, in Brisbane and proceeded to get aquainted with the local tipple introduced to us by the esteemed cousin of my most highly esteemed trvelling companion. The best thind about this side of the world is that you can pretend that you are on the other side of the world. Back home, in Blighty, I mean. Super markets sell what one would expect and even sell it in English. So our first week in Australia was spent making Shepheards Pies, mashing potatos and devouring round after round of cheese and pickle sandwiches. And of course washing it down with plenty of vinum, which is unfortunatly absent in other parts of the world. I would like to say that we did more but a irresistable sence of `we have come home` overcame our travel worn enthusiasm and it was all too easy to sit back and watch Neighbours on the TV. The delights of the city did not entirely ellude us however we dragged ourselves away from the sofa on day and made it to the Brisbane Museum to aquainte ourselves with the great Captain James Cook and another day we managedto stroll through the trees along the South Bank of the Brisbane river. On our last night staying with cousin Julia, her chap, James organised a terrific trip into Brisbane`s district of indulgence, the Valley. Her we danced and drank the finest Tasmanian Champagne before we were moved to another cousin`s house the next day. Emilina had had us over to her house for a roast beef dinner earlier in the week and we had had great fun playing with her small, small children now we arrived on the saturday night to show the girl some good old fashioned English drinking fun while the kids were staying with dad. In this, of course, we suceeded. After a while everyone had doned ceremonial dressing gowns in order to chase the night into the morning and it is needless to say that when the children returned the next evening the adults had not been risen long. That evening was spent watching Harry Potter and Beauty and the Beast as most evenings in households with children are. The next day the children were sent to day care so that once again the adults could have fun and this time we took ourselves to a Koala (not bear) sanctury so that I could feed the Kangaroos and hold a Koala. That evening with the advent of another relative, Dion`s charming aunt Helen, we comenced the drinking once again and talked and sang well into the evening. A successful start to our Australian adventure.</P><hr size='1'>
