<H1>Diary for Dion and Duane</H1><hr size='1'><H2>There`s nothing like a capital</H2><H3>2007-04-01 to 2007-04-02</H3><P>Well, we have made it to the north.  After a train journey that promise to be so much worse than it turned out, we were dropped in the bustling metropolis that is Delhi.  [It`s interesting, why would I want a rickshaw from one guy when he saw me turn down one of his competitors a few seconds before.  They are an optimistic bunch.]  We found our hotel (not actually on the road they claimed it to be on, but close enough), had a wonderful shower and set out to see what Delhi has to offer.  First stop - the Red Fort.  It certainly is red and contains some very impressive architecture, but it`s just a fort.  So back out into the blistering heat and down some crowded, but very interesting market streets.  We were looking for food, but stumbled across instead the Jama Masjid Mosque (the largest mosque in India).  We were refused admission due to our attire, but completed a circuit of the mosque, thwarted an eager young pickpocket and headed into a cafe for a currey.

</P><P>A walk down the Meena Bazaar later, as the faithful were being called to pray, made us feel walking back to the hotel may be a nice way to see some of old Delhi.  Once again we were a touch overambitious concerning how far we could realistically walk and so jumped in a rickshaw and headed to the main bazaar.
</P><P>
</P><P>Local elections are begin held in Delhi in the not too distant future and so politicians are on the campaign trail.  Unbeknown to us, we had been marked with the symbol of one of the political parties at the Red Fort and were only saved the embarrassment of having to explain out political persuasion by some crafty work by Stephen.  Stephen, an ex-pat, had  been living in India for years and so was wise to the situation in Delhi.  He suggested to us that we leave politics to the residents of Delhi, have a drink or two and watch the cricket.
</P><P>
</P><P>Another day and yet more sun.  I`m beginning to miss the rain (that`s the Manc in me talking).  We set off early to sort a train to the north and deal with the visa issue.  It seems you cannot book a train from Delhi without your passport and so we turned for help to the internet and have found an alternative method of visa application.  Success, and so with the rest of the day to spend in Delhi, we turn to the guidebook for advice and spend some time ambling around some of Delhi`s many Bazaars.</P><hr size='1'>
