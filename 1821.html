<H1>Diary for Dion and Duane</H1><hr size='1'><H2>Apologies for spelling i`m a little drunk, Duane.</H2><H3>2007-02-04 to 2007-02-09</H3><P>Well, well, well ... i have finally been made to take an hour out of busy schedule to inform all you misserable chaps chapettesque what i`ve been doing while you no doubt have been working (or not). After that first night in Barcelona we awoke with a moderate hangover and decided to have a picnic in somesort of Gaudiesque park (lovely). Then walked about in order to compose ourself for a couple of drinks in the evening in another park (notice a theme developing). In the evening`s park we watched a couple of young Spanish couples learn to tango in a band stand ... and ...?... well it was a long time ago. The next day we went to the Neu Camp but felt a little tired and so did not take on the might of Barcelona (although it was clear that we would have been the stronger side). More Parks ... and a train to Paris over night.
</P><P>
</P><P>Right Paris. Dawn broke in Paris and found us already sipping coffee and eating croissants with an effortlessly Parisian manner in a cafe close to the Garre du Nord. Having ditched our bags at our Paris address we climbed the streets of Monmartre to get our first glimpse of our new city.
</P><P>
</P><P>With arough route etched out in our minds we returned to street level and proceeded to make a grand tour of the city. We spent the day fullfilling our duty as tourists and having our photos taken about such monuments as the sacre cour, the louvre, the arc de triumph (which we ascended and ammused ourselves with the traffic), the tour d`Eiffel, the statue of Libertry (French edition) and the grand gothic eddifice of Notre-Dame de Paris.
</P><P>
</P><P>Dinner was already arranged at Chartier - a restaurant that is without doubt the most charming in the whole of the French capital. Here we feasted on snails, steak, fish and cheese flushed down with a fine bottle of vin rouge.
</P><P>
</P><P>Aquiring a taste for the finner things in life we hioked back up Monmartre and sat drinking plus vin and gazing over the city below.
</P><P>
</P><P>Morning. Hangover. Recovery - art. There is a small gallery on the Seine that reached international fame through the pages of Dan Brown. The Louvre is famous for its enormous collection of disappointing masterpieces. Having, however, discovered one or two gems amoungst the throng of discerning American art lovers battling for a glimspe of da Vinci`s "anti-climax in blue and green," we realised that the day was spent and our bed did beckon.
</P><P>
</P><P>RIght kids, last day. thanks for sticking with me. What was left ... ah yes the tower. Up and down was made quite tricky by the wind but with determination we scalled and at the top i won Eiffel tower top trumps. success.
</P><P>
</P><P>Having spied the chuch containing the mortal remains of Napolean from the top we thought it our British duty to make sure the Corsican was not up to any of his trade mark mischief. As we walked down the champs de Mars, however, the skies behind the Eiffel tower grew very dark. As we turned into the church yard the hevans opened and a terrifying torent was unleashed upon us. By the time we made to ascend the steps of the church hail stones the size of musket balls were frustrating our advance and determination. That no Englishman should disturb the slumber of Napolean was surely the message sent from the skies and so we ducked down an alyway for a coffee. Within seconds of our tack once more the sun appeared to smile upon our stay with the French. SO with climatic civility restored and the Entante Cordiale intact we skipped back through the puddles of the churchyard wistleing `Rule Britannia` and leaving Bonaparte well alone.
</P><P>
</P><P>We finished our stay in Paris the way it began. On the slopes of Monmartre drinking wine and singing.</P><hr size='1'>
