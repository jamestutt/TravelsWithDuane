<H1>Diary for Dion and Duane</H1><hr size='1'><H2>Sydney.</H2><H3>2007-07-19 to 2007-07-25</H3><P>We arrived off the plane st about 9 in the mornign and got a taxi straight to the house of our most hospitable hosts: The Delaneys. Then, having enjoyed a fortifying breakfast headed into town to see that opera house. Well as you can imagine the opera house was the same as it is in all the photos but the harbour bridge is slightly more impressive in real life. That night we were taken for drinks at the local club and talked all night on every subject. The next day we headed back into the city and headed for the observatory to look at telescopes and the like and after this we headed over the bridge to get a glimpse of the harbour from the other side. That night we explored the darker side of Sydney with a couple of drinks in Kings Cross. The day after Dion stumbbled across a book that took his fancy and for the next two days read it. Once Harry Potter was dead. We resumed our sight seeing, ascending the Sydney tower to gaze over the city and popping into the aquanrium which was really good. For all this time we were treated to lovely food, good conversation and excelent company by the Delaney family - thank you very much.</P><hr size='1'>
