<H1>Diary for Dion and Duane</H1><hr size='1'><H2>A suit too far!</H2><H3>2007-04-28 to 2007-05-01</H3><P>A quick jump down the coast and we find ourselves almost by the seaside on the banks of the Thu Bon river.  Aching and pleased to be off the bus we send Glenn on a fact-finding mission and he discovers a free hotel (it`s a Vietnamese holiday, possibly the Vietnamese new year and so the place is busy) and so we move in and set about discovering the town.
</P><P>
</P><P>We are a ten minute walk from the historic old town of Hoi An and so wander along past the shops selling tailored made suits (there are a lot of these), shoes and tat made out of wood.  To this day i think we should have paid to enter the old town, but being poor travellers and the place being covered in alley ways it didn`t seems necessary.
</P><P>
</P><P>After a delightful dinner, we decide to have a look at some tailors.  A dangerous move, the girls who work there are like vultures.  They give you food, water, are forever producing flattering comments and some of their finest material.  At times like these i wish i had done some textiles at school - what determines a good fabric?  Anyway, before the evening is out Glenn has ordered an all white suit and i have a DJ being made for me.  I`m even told to call the owner of the shop Mum!!
</P><P>
</P><P>Time for some culture and so we go on a tour (i`m begining to get a little sick of these things) to some ancient Hindu ruins that are apparently older than Angkor Wat!!  The Americans had done some precise demolishion work on these temples (My Son), but there are still some impressive remains.  A boat trip back provided a pleasant way to see the bank of the river and we were provided with lunch (or should i say a snack) of rice and a banana!
</P><P>
</P><P>Another afternoon, another chance to be persuaded to have another suit made.  This time Duane is drawn into buying a pure Kashmir suit (very nice it is too) and Freddy gets the first of what will turn out to be many purchases.  We spend the evening, like most evenings, playing pool and then heading to the busiest bar we can find.  We spend the night drinking with some English and Australians and i get into a heated debate with an American - they are fun to argue with!
</P><P>
</P><P>So, with clouds still in sky and the threat of rain on the horizon, we head off for our suit fittings.  My DJ is perfect as is Duanes 3 piece suit and so we decide to get another each.  More measuring and banter with the girls and so yet another day to spend in Hoi An.  There`s only so much wandering up and down the river you can do.
</P><P>
</P><P>With their Visa`s dangerously close to expiring we part ways with Glenn and Freddy (not before Freddy orders another suit) as they head off to Saigon.  A most enjoyable time spent with those lads and i wish them all the best (although they will never read this blog, far too busy for that sort of thing).
</P><P>
</P><P>Our suits are finished, the postwoman has come and taken our money and our suits (with a little insurance, but i would have liked a little more) and we are ready to head to Nha Trang.  I`ve never realy enjoyed shopping before. Is there hope for me yet?</P><hr size='1'>
