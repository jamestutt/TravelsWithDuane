<H1>Diary for Dion and Duane</H1><hr size='1'><H2>and so onto the islands - where to start?</H2><H3>2007-06-12 to 2007-06-23</H3><P>After a entertaining stay in Bangkok it was time to organise our VIP bus (the only way to travel) and head down to Surat Thani and onto our boat to Koh Pangan.  We arrived and moved into our hotel (Mac`s bay) where our beach side bungalow overlooked the white sand, blue sea and off in the distance was Ko Samui.  Our landlady, Lope, was an ex-pat and clearly an ex-traveller and so was the source of any information about SE Asia, Australia, New Zealand......lets just say anywhere in the world.......you could possibly want.  So we settled in, got used to our pool, met the other guests and worked on the tan.
</P><P>
</P><P>The Mac`s bay resort was the location of the black moon party.  Smaller scale and less well heard of than the full moon, but we were promised a good night.  So after realxing all day and stocking up on supplies of alcohol to be hidden in our bungalow, the trance was turned up, people began to arrive (we didn`t have to pay for our ticket!) and the party got started.  From here on in everything is an awesome blur.  It rained a couple of times, so we got wet.  The music failed a couple of times, so people danced to tunes in there heads.  I`d like to say there was a sing-song, but i`m pretty sure that never happened.
</P><P>
</P><P>After adorning myself with my luminous tatoo (that washed off in the next rain shower) the sun began to rise and a few hours later the party died down.  Raving after dawn - quite an experience!  Lope appeared, uncalled for, on the dancefloor with cups of tea (legend) and we sloped off to our balconies and chatted until we had wined down enough to sleep.
</P><P>
</P><P>A couple of days to recover in the pool and on the beach in the sunshine and then we decided that it was time to move on.  Off to Koh Tao and dive school.  If you don`t do any diving on Koh Tao, there isn`t a lot else to do (as Duane can testify to) and so i went off on my course and Duane caught up on some of his favourite authors.  
</P><P>
</P><P>The diving was incredible.  Not so much for the coral (it was pretty badly damaged) but for the marine life.  Massive schools of fish over a thousand strong, turtles and a juvenile Whale Shark.  Awesome!!!!
</P><P>
</P><P>After a few more days just lying around on the beach we organised ourselves a trip into Malaysia and Kuala Lumpa.  The overnight slow boat from Koh Tao took us back to Surat Thani and from there we caught a mini-bus to the border.  After a slight mix-up and a little heated debate we then got on a luxury bus that took us the remaining 8 hours to KL where we arrived at 12am, went straight to China town - had a beer and went to bed.
</P><P>
</P><P>KL.  What a city.  We got up, took the tube and got to KLCC (Kuala Lumpa Conference Centre) the home of the Petronas towers (depending on your classifiaction they are the largest pair of towers in the world and the 3rd largest buildings).  They are massive!  Didn`t get there early enough to go to the skybridge, but were told the view from the KL tower (the fifth tallest tower in the world) was far superior, as you could get higher up it.  It was spectcular and greatly helped with our further navigation of the city.
</P><P>
</P><P>Off to Times Sqaure - the largest shopping mall i have ever seen.  KL does it big!!  We got lost in electronic shops for a while.  I bought a cheap, but pretty cool new mp4 player and we went to the theme park on the top floor.  Lots of roller-coasters and fair ground attractions - it was like being 12 again.
</P><P>
</P><P>After a brief wander around the street stalls in China town (cheap hoddies for the on-coming cold) we returned to KLCC to see Petronas at night and it didn`t disappoint.  So ends our SE Asia experience and it is back to the Western[ised] world.  Just one final stop before that though - the greatest ariport in the world.........Singapore!</P><hr size='1'>
