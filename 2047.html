<H1>Diary for Dion and Duane</H1><hr size='1'><H2>A quick dip into the capital of Rajasthan</H2><H3>2007-04-14 to 2007-04-15</H3><P>Having stayed longer than expected in Udaipur we were left a morning to tackle the overwhelming Pink city.  An early wake up call from the train conductor at 7 am plunged us both into foul moods and so we commandeered a rickshaw driver and went for a leisurely breakfast.  With our mood much improved by sandwiches and the sweet taste of chi we decided to take on the sights of Jaipur and headed off to Janta Mantra, the astronomical observatory of Jaipur.  Feeling quite in my element we set about learning how the massive sundials worked, how this could be used to create a birthchart and how to find the latitude and longitude of Jaipur.  I WANT ONE!!!!!
</P><P>
</P><P>Our trusty ricshaw driver was waiting outside and whisked us off to the Amber fort which afforded us spectacular views of the ancient city of Amber and of the 3 beautifully decorated palaces off the Maharaja.  Duane was even able to confront his fears and sit down beside a snake charmer - the snake wasn`t having any of it and barely managed to rear up.

</P><P>With thoughts of our flight the following day lingering in our mind, we decided to attempt to get to Dehi that day.  All aboard the bus at 13:30 and so began our long and arduous journey to Delhi.  Time spent on the main road was pleasant enough, but buses are very bad at entering major cities and we spent hours negotiating the Delhi traffic.  After being dropped off at some unknown location in Delhi we were unable to locate a rickshaw.  Whenever you actually need one they disappear off the face of the Earth as if to mock you and so we had to get a peddle rickshaw, with all our stuff and mostly uphill.  Poor driver almost had a heartattack - good excersise though!
</P><P>
</P><P>Now it was 11 pm and we found a hotel and a bar and put the frustrating trip behind us.  I am not a violent man, but if someone had given me reason to get annoyed I may have had to dispose of a body.  Fortunately enough any drop in Delhi`s population has nothing to do with me!

</P><P>Check out time was at 12 as so we took the chance to catch up on some lost sleep and then took to wandering the streets of Delhi until it was time to end this Indian experince and head of into SE Asia.

</P><P>Such a diverse and beautiful country.  6 weeks is no-where near long enough to discover all of the treasures that lay hidden within its vast expanse of countryside.  Any climate you would wish to expience or any type of land, India can offer it in a charming and traditional way.  Another country down, Vietnam has a lot to live up to!</P><hr size='1'>
