<H1>Diary for Dion and Duane</H1><hr size='1'><H2>Berliner Blog: 24 hours in the German capital.</H2><H3>2007-02-13 to 2007-02-14</H3><P>As an Aussie girl once pointed out to me in Paris there are only two things that are essential to  trip to the German capital. The Pub crawl and the walking tour. We arrived and proceeded to the meeting station for the pub crawl. ... I awoke feeling quite drunk and wearing three glow sticks around my wrist and so went to meet the people for the walking tour.

</P><P>The tour was excellent so good that i ended up paying for it with a substantal tip. And now my German history is well up to scratch. Did you know that Napolean had so much respect for Frederick the Great that when he marched into Berlin, at the foot of the Prussians statue he bayed his men to remove their hats instucting them that if this man were still alive they would never have entered the city. Also the Berlin wall fell through a mistake made by a drunk socialist at a press conference. The memorial to the murded Jews of Europe is quite a chilling abstract, subjective construction. And he-who-must-not-be-named pertinently unacknowledged by a car park. Excellent city one of my favourites but it dosen`t half tear your emotions out of your skin. Quite poignant. Ich bin ein Berliner.</P><hr size='1'>
