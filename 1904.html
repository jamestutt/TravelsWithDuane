<H1>Diary for Dion and Duane</H1><hr size='1'><H2>Munich, beer and German sausage.</H2><H3>2007-02-19 to 2007-02-21</H3><P>Well having been in the most horrific motorbike crash of my life so far this morning i have decided to sit down for a while in the Goa shade to fill you guys in a bit. Let`s start in Munich. There`s not a lot to say about this city, being the beer capital of the world it speaks for itself. Having arrived at about 6 am, we made our way quite sleep deprived to our hostel, buzzing from gallons of coffee at about 10. "i`m sorry but you wont be able to cheak in untill 2:30," said a hard to place girl behind the counter: hard to place because she effortlessly skipped between languages producing flawless accents in each as a menagerie of wieried travellers pilled into the hostel. Later she will become Liz. "But please go through to the bar and help yourself to tea and coffee from the breakfast buffet then have a shower if you wish - just up stairs on the right." Relief. "Alright chaps," a voice jumped in our path as we entered the bar. Oli - i last saw him looking quite worse for ware late at night on a street corner in Amsterdam. I too was a little over the hill that night and despite an excellent evening in the dutch capital neither of us thought to exchange detail and so it was a delight to be startled by him. Revived by a good english accent and the promise of a tour of the Munich`s famous beer halls we followed Oli to the Hofbräuhaus where, with over flowing steins we merrily - very merrily - spent the day watching be-lederhosen-ed Bavarians dancing to fiddles whilst eating pretzel and wurst.

</P><P>Back at the hostel, after a nap, i found Dion in the bar drinking Long Island ice teas with Oli and Glen (Kiwi whom we drank with in Paris and who also made a cameo at Auschwitz). One needs to say little else about that day. 
</P><P>
</P><P>I awoke the next day with an enthusiastic Oli at the end of my bed encouraging me to start the day. The plan was to visit some Bavarian Schloss in the mountains and sap up a bit of culture to prize us from our hagovers. We were however diverted from this pursuit by the hostel staff informing us that Shrove Tuesday  provided the steel-livered Muncheners another excuse to drink all day. The city was closed to traffic and the streets were full of costumes, loud music and confetti. After a couple of medicinal ales and a morning streatch to YMCA we started to feel decidedly underdressed and so returned to the hostel to doll ouselves up a bit. Having enquired at reception where in Munich one would find the best place to get face paint, we found to our surprise that our hosts had preempted us and had the paints there waiting. So being led behind the counter we were kitted out with colourful faces by the multi-talented Liz. Soon after two clowns, two monks a suspiciously masculine girl, a truly demonic Dion and a host of other revellers were battling through the now impossibly, tightly packed streets of Munich. 
</P><P>
</P><P>The rest of the day is sketchy. There was a table, people dancing on the table, then a broken table, on which sat a lot of people wearing surprissed expressions. A lot of singing.  A lot of dancing. A lot of drinking with Liz and a Mancunian called Dave. An Hurculean scrum for a toilet. "New York, New York." A dance - home, a dance on the bar. smugged make up and a rousing recantation of 99 luftballons on the bar finished off with a toast to excellent  drinking companions for shrove Tuesday in Munich. 
</P><P>
</P><P>We joined a free walking tour the next day. I remember little. A farewell drink with Oli then a night train to Sicily and Bertie.</P><hr size='1'>
