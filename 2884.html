<H1>Diary for Dion and Duane</H1><hr size='1'><H2>North - West - North - East - North</H2><H3>2007-08-19 to 2007-08-22</H3><P>With the all action, adrenaline capital of the world safely behind us we set out to explore the temperate rainforest and glacier covered West coast of NZ.  An epic drive across snow covered mountains to the sea took us within spitting distance of the Franz Josef glacier (so named because it looks like Austro-Hungarian leaders beard) and so we put on our crampons and headed up the icey face.  Spectacular blue coloured ice caves and stunning views down the valley were in store for us.  Money well spent.

</P><P>With the luxury of a hostel, we bought some beer and settled down to watch Arnie at his best, protecting a young John Connor.

</P><P>Leving the West coast sea, the time had come to change islands and so we took the treacherous crossing of Auther`s pass over towards Christchurch and headed north. A brief camp was called for in order to regain our strength and then we made it to the ferry crossing, borded the most expensive ferry in the world and were deposited near the centre of Wellington.  north island here we come!</P><hr size='1'>
