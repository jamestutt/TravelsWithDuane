<H1>Diary for Dion and Duane</H1><hr size='1'><H2>Time to explore the Mekong</H2><H3>2007-05-13 to 2007-05-15</H3><P>On our trip thus far we have been able to aquaint ourselves with a number of rivers, none more-so than the mighty Gangees; however, we felt that we hadn`t given the Mekong the attention it deserved, especially as it would be accompaning us on our trip north through Cambodia and Laos.  How better to get a feel for a river than on a three day boat trip?
</P><P>
</P><P>On a dark and dank morning, joined by our water proof macks and our new travelling buddies, the lovely Gemma, Alison and Susan, we headed off to our boat with our enthusiastic guide and went to one of the many islands on the Mekong delta.  Here the woman make coconut candy (very nice) and the men drink and play cards (so i at least have my retirement sorted).  We had Vietanamese tea and got to hold a python (much to Duane`s apprehension).
</P><P>
</P><P>A short trip further around the delta and the heavens opened - clever British boys and girls had water proofs though - and we were rowed up a small channel to eat some fresh fruit and listen to some traditional Vietnam music.  The fruit was lovely!!!
</P><P>
</P><P>Back to shore, Can Tho, and we are checked into an hotel and headout for dinner by the river and sample some of the very cheap and suprisingly good local beer, we are also able to pay our respects to a massive statue of Uncle Ho (as he is affectionately now known)
</P><P>
</P><P>Another day and anther early start as we head off to the Cai Rang – Phong Dien Floating Market.  The boats are clearly showing off their wares with samples of their produce set high on masts above their boats.  Everything is available for people feeling a little worse for wear be it fruit, water or even a cold beer (some of these travelling types are big drinkers!)  We`re then wisked off to see how rice noodles are made, saw some pigs on the farm next to the rice noodles (much to Duanes delight) and taken to Chau Doc for the evening and the opportunity to climb Sam Mountain and visit The Thien Hau Temple.  Being adventurous sorts, we embarked on the climb with the rain begining to fall.  The view from the top at sunset is fantastic, we have been told, as when we arrived the monsoon opened up in all its glory and we were hard pushed to see each other.  Back down the mountain, off to our hotel to dry off and then to bed.
</P><P>
</P><P>Another early rise and after going to a rice wine making factory and a crocodile farm our group was disbanded and all those who were going in Cambodia boarded the boat (this included all the girls).  After a pleasant cruise upstream past lots of rural villages and children playing in the river we arrived at the border.  Our guide disappeared off to smooth over the procedure and we had lunch.  Within an hour and a half we were in Cambodian territory, the rural villages were gone, the land was oe massive open plain and it began to rain.
</P><P>
</P><P>Before we knew what had happened we were lakeside in Phnon Penh.  Our tour in Vietnam had come to an end!
</P><P>
</P><P>Due to being a man who has no problems with trying new foods i have been given the unenviable task of eating random foods others want to try.  Due to this i have been able to experience frogs (not very daring, but we did see them strung up live the next day), snake and eel.  Bugs are round the corner, i can feel it!</P><hr size='1'>
