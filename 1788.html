<H1>Diary for Dion and Duane</H1><hr size='1'><H2>And so it begins</H2><H3>2007-02-03 to 2007-02-04</H3><P>Well, I find myself in Spain, at a computer in a very clean hostel with a hangover.  How best to piece together what happened yesterday.  It´s safe to say that 4 am is a time created by an old testament God and is a time neither I nor Duane ever wish to frequent again.
</P><P>
</P><P>So Barcelona.  A remarkably beautiful city, but i fear Gaudi was a touch mad.  They call it art and it certainly draws the eye.  The Sagrada Familia is a beautiful church, but after all this time i really feel they should have got round to finishing it.  Just lazy if you ask me.
</P><P>
</P><P>Spent the rest of the day wondering aound parks, going to see the sea and spending money climbing just about any momument we could.  Bad news for the budget, but we have decided to fast for a while so no doubt we will make it up.
</P><P>
</P><P>In the evening we walked for miles to go to the Font Magica just off Plaça d´Espanya to watch the coloured fountains while listening to classical music.  I´m begining to feel very cultured and if anyone comes to Barcelona it would be up there in my list of things to do.
</P><P>
</P><P>Several bottles of wine later and some dancing in the street, we managed to negotiate the metro system home.  I´m sure it didn´t need to be as hard as in was, but I blame the language barrier.</P><hr size='1'>
