<H1>Diary for Dion and Duane</H1><hr size='1'><H2>Around the princes highway</H2><H3>2007-07-25 to 2007-08-02</H3><P>Being in Sydney and wanting to be in Melbourne gave me a chance to flex some driving muscles and tak on the winding and twisty roads of the Princes highway (and surrounding detours).  My continual search for an ever more bendy road frequently took us miles out of the way, but i was having fun and Duane was reading about wizards and Dark Lords (probably for the best as he is not the worlds best passenger!)  A couple of days later we arrived safely and without incident in Melbourne and moved into the Ritz (the backpacking hostel above the pub where the neighbours night is held).
</P><P>
</P><P>The hostel was filled with long-term Australia travellers and so they were a working bunch fresh from the norh and the trials and tribulations of fruit picking.  We were made welcome and encouraged to drink...........i think we found a place we could settle in for a while.  Our time in Melbourne was eventful.  Duane proved to be a man of many talents when he won a trip to Sydney in a sing the neighbours theme tune competition (was even complimented be Mal Kennedy!!), the hostel provided a free cheese and goon night, and there was the obligitory meeting with Dr. Karl (came second in the neighbours quiz too, but there`s no prizes for second!)
</P><P>
</P><P>That`s the Oz experience done and dusted and so our thoughts have turned to the country over the ditch with it`s cold weather and snow.......</P><hr size='1'>
