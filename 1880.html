<H1>Diary for Dion and Duane</H1><hr size='1'><H2>Messy in Messina</H2><H3>2007-02-22 to 2007-02-24</H3><P>If you speak to any Sicilian, the most boring city on the island is Messina.  Undeterred and there already we decided to see the sites.  The problem of travelling without a mobile phone is that if you wish to meet up with someone you have to rely on the internet (not particularly useful for an immediate response) and payphones (I wasn’t sure they even still existed), but with a mixture of luck and good planning we met up with Bertie and the fun could begin.
</P><P>
</P><P>Alex, Bertie’s brother, also appeared in town and we headed out for a couple of drinks and some food.  Bertie teaches the Sicilians the mother tongue and so we headed out to central Messina without our guide to check out the sites.  Messina has the tallest astronomical clock in Europe, a figurine on top of a radio mast in the harbour………………….and lots of cafes (good coffee!!)
</P><P>
</P><P>That night we decided to do a pub crawl of Messina’s bars.  We then needed something else to do and so after spending a lot of time in the final bar we headed back to Bertie’s flat, went skinny dipping (not hugely recommended in February) and then danced the night away.
</P><P>
</P><P>A splendid time was had by all, much due to Bertie’s hospitality.  If you ever plan to go to Sicily, why not check out Messina.  We can turn it into a tourist hotspot yet.

</P><P>As an aside I will never again hear bad things said about Italian engineering.  They devised a way to load trains onto a ferry.  No need to disembark one side only to get onto another train on the other side.  Almost magical!!</P><hr size='1'>
