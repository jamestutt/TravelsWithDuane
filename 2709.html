<H1>Diary for Dion and Duane</H1><hr size='1'><H2>Kroombit Cowboy (Ringer) College.</H2><H3>2007-07-08 to 2007-07-14</H3><P>I have just graduated from cowboy college having spent the last week on the back of a horse herding live stock in the central Queensland outback while installing a 3 tonne beer fridge and drinking rum and dust in the evenings and shooting shotguns for the hell of it to a Dolly Parton-esque soundtrack. This was Kroombit cattle Station. Recomendeed to us by a girl in a tube on a river in Laos as an excellent place to have fun and save money in Australia by doing a little casual labour. She was right - brilliant fun. Although a working cattle station, the farm also hosts the `oz-experience` travellers as they pass up and down the east coast and so every afternoon and eveing a new bus load of young folk would arrive looking for the real outback experience and it was up to us to give it to them. This meant learning fast. "Be happy and enthusiastic and look like you have done it a million times before," Replied Andrew when I asked what a goat rodeo was as he drove us to give hima hand running it on our first day. Wrestling goats for the delight of the paying puntters was the answer that he refrained from giving me. But while the cooler in the ute still had a couple of cans of Bunderburg left there was no shortage of enthusiasm the same applied to the clay pigeon shooting, of which Dion with equal enthusiam fell into the roll of master of the trap. Now this job was not all fun and games. I should let it be known that it was up to us to wash the canyons of dirty dishes that appeared after dinner in the evenings. And too to us fell the task of installing a new beer fridge for the bar. Now we were in Australia. they drink a lot of beer in Australia. Also we were in the out back. This means that there is a lot of room. So our fridge was naturally not your every day domestic device. The three tonne shipping container had to be raised above the ground on stilts, which were to be crafted and installed by you two humble English enginers. We rose to the task (at 6 every morning; a cold time of day for those who had spent the proceeding 16 weeks in the very hot) and in fact quite enjoyed it. And when we weren`t diggin holes, wrestling goats, shooting pigeons, riding horses or washing dishes we found time for a good old fashin hoe-down. Absolutely amazing. I want to go back.</P><hr size='1'>
