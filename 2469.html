<H1>Diary for Dion and Duane</H1><hr size='1'><H2>Lao</H2><H3>2007-05-24 to 2007-06-06</H3><P>We arrived on a small island in the middle on the Me kong just north of the Lao border with no money. The island was called Dan Dat and our host was called Mr Mo. We opened up a credit account with Mr Mo and then went about doing nothing for two days except for lying around in hammocks, swimming in the river, jumping out of trees and drinking far too much lao lao (I shudder to even recall its name). Time was against us and so we had to leave Don Dat. Mr Mo`s man escorted us to Pakse to settle our tab and after an afternoon drinking coffee and reading in a popular Indian cafe we found ourselves on the nicest bus I have ever encountered on our way to Vientiane. After 40 minutes in the capital (I had it on good authority that the place was quite the dullest city on the Earth) we were on another bus to Vang Vieng.What to say about Vang Vieng. The town exists for the utter gratification of those childish tendencies that growing up is supposed to quash and university fosters. A giant adventure play ground for 20-something-year-old children with beer. So for five days we floated down the river in large inner tubes getting slowly merry on Beer Lao and compulsory free shots of lao lao, swinging or increasingly higher rope swings and regressing by about twenty years. For those times when tubing was not an option the town offered that perpetual Sunday morning comfort zone. It was compulsory to recline on the cushions in the cafes and all the tables faced a TV that was endlessly screening Friends or the Simpsons. On one particular occasion I did manage to fall into a 7 hour Friends frenzy unable to leave until I was certain that Ross and Rachael would finally get it together in the end. It was in Vang Vieng that we met Freddy again. This of course put our departure date back another couple of days. However, when we finally got around to leaving we found ourselves in Luang Pra Bang in the early twentieth century with all the French colonial ... je ne sais quoi still as charming now as it must have been in `39. We spent our time here lazily drinking coffee but one day took ourselves to a water fall for some swimming (and unplanned hiking) and a couple of bears and a tiger thrown in for good measure. After Luang Pra Bang two more days up the Me Kong by boat and we were leaving Lao behind us.</P><hr size='1'>
