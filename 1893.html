<H1>Diary for Dion and Duane</H1><hr size='1'><H2>Firenze (not the Harry Potter character)</H2><H3>2007-02-26 to 2007-02-27</H3><P>Arrived in Florence after dark to see il Domo beautifully lit up against the star studded sky, with Venus hovering above the Western horizon (I had a feeling I would like this place).
</P><P>
</P><P>In keeping with tradition we felt lubrication was necessary before undertaking a night tour of the city and so a pint later we were taking in the wonderful architecture and sculpture in the city.  Eventually we fortified a position on a bridge opposite the Ponte Vechio (means old bridge – I wonder what it was called when it was new?) and merrily chatted as the night slipped away.
</P><P>
</P><P>It was like we have entered a different country.  Every other person in Florence is an American.  Not a problem as such, but their continually enthusiasm about how everything is awesome does become draining (we pretended to be German – a reasonably successful tactic).
</P><P>
</P><P>It was finally time to go and see the last major site on our European list.  A sculpture of perfect human form that is apparently the only piece of sculpture anyone needs to see (all other sculptures will be no more than a disappointment).  In my humble opinion however, Michelangelo gave his sculpture of David slightly big hands…………but who am I to question a master.
</P><P>
</P><P>As Florence is quite a small city and we felt we had been under using our legs we decided to take on the hill to the Bronze copy of David.  Looks pretty much the same, but in green and he is a little thinner (they clearly don’t feed the copies very well), but the view from the hill was worth the walk.  It was a beautiful day in Florence and so a perfect opportunity to try some of the famous ice cream.</P><hr size='1'>
