<H1>Diary for Dion and Duane</H1><hr size='1'><H2>Sap`s your energy</H2><H3>2007-04-22 to 2007-04-24</H3><P>Following recommendations from friends and fellow travellers alike, we turned our attention to the north of Vietnam and the mountains; and so boarding our train late at night we headed off towards the Chinese border and the town of Sapa.
</P><P>
</P><P>After not much sleep, for a change, we arrived, checked in and headed off to the Sapa market where a whole host of seemingly pointless parafernalia was thrust in our directions.  Fighting off the flash backs of India we had some banter with the locals, were adorned with bracelets (free of charge) and bought some tat - it seemed only fair.
</P><P>
</P><P>Back to the hotel for lunch (I don`t want to alarm you, but a dead dog was seen in the kitchen, prime for cooking) and then we met our guide, Lam, who took us down to Cat Cat Village, the site of a beautiful waterfall.  A swift motorbike ride back (there was no way i was going to drag myself back up that hill) and it was time for dinner.  After a few sociable dinks we headed off to a bar where the local tibal girls were successfully hustling every foreigner that came in at pool.
</P><P>
</P><P>An early start as Lam took us on our 12 km trekk (mostly downhill) through the rice fields of the local tribes.  Terraced farming with an incredible irrigation system took me back to my Geography GCSE.  Stepping stones were a neccessary obsticale to overcome in the flooded fields and as a Frenchman lead the way I, heroically, helped a family in my wake.  Good job the Frenchman was in front as he pointed out a paricularly hazardos point by manfully falling into a ditch.  It was all I could do to suppress my laughter.
</P><P>
</P><P>After making friends with some more locals, who made Duane and I garlands shaped like hearts, we came to the village of Loa Chai, populated by the H`mong people - they are all very small!!!.  We then went to the village of Ta Van (Dzay people) had lunch and were given a speedy return to the hotel in a mini-bus.
</P><P>
</P><P>Sufficiently tried, but well fed, we returned the way we came, back to Loa Cai train station and headed back to Hanoi on the night train, where we were greeted by our friendly hotel staff and given a bed to recuperate in for a couple of hours free of charge!!  Time to head south and see what the rest of this country as to offer.</P><hr size='1'>
