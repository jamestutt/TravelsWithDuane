<H1>Diary for Dion and Duane</H1><hr size='1'><H2>All roads lead to Rome at some point.</H2><H3>2007-02-24 to 2007-02-26</H3><P>Well i had composed a beautiful essay detailing why i find Rome one of the most disappointing cities in Italy but i was advised by my optimistic companion that we are supposed to be having fun so let me tell you about our fun in Rome. 
</P><P>
</P><P>Exhasted from the train from Sicily i found the route to our hostel quite a hassel due mainly to the incomprehensible Roman bus network. But having arrived we were enthusiastically welcomed by a group of drunk Romanians. The next day we decided to take in the sites and having walked past the queue for i Vaticani Musei e S. Pietro we ambled around the Pantheon and the Trevi justling with tourists and snapping the appropriate photos before heading through the Forum Romani to the once great Colosseum. Roman ruins have been very well ruined so these days little remains but great voids where greater bulidings once stood. the Colosseum however is still quite extrodinary.  Having taken our fill of the ancient sights we wondered up to the Spanish steps to complete  our circuit of the torist tit-bits. We forced our way through the Americans back to S. Pietro and (...queue...queue...) what an enormous church and what an enormous climb to the top of the dome. Having read some latin and noted a Michelangelo we dinned in front of the Pantheon before returnong to the hostel and joining the Romanians in their merry-making.

</P><P>The following morning we strolled back to the Musei Vaticani or should i say past the museum - about 1km past - to join the back of the entrance queue. We were swept through the museum by a rapid current of American and Japaneese flash photography but  settled a while in the Sistine chapel with its contingent of Americans, militant security guards and a lovely ceiling. We finished our stay in the eternal city by getting an afternoon train to Florence.</P><hr size='1'>
