<H1>Diary for Dion and Duane</H1><hr size='1'><H2>Time for something a little more tropical</H2><H3>2007-07-14 to 2007-07-19</H3><P>Whether it be the need to dangle from a cable over the canopy of the rainforest, dive on a natural phenomena visible from the moon (apparently!) or just hang-out playing poker for monopoly money and having BBQ`s then Cairnes is the place to be.  We arrived late in the day and were suprised and a little lost not to have a collection of people ready to whisk us away to our hostel and so we had to find one ourselves.  With that panic over we headed out into town to soak up a bit of the party atmosphere and plan our stay.
</P><P>
</P><P>We wanted to go over the canopy of the rainforest (which also gave us the chance to ride on a Harry Potter style train - excitment for the new book was building) and so we booked that and it was well worth the trip.  Stunning landscape!  We wanted to dive on the reef and so headed out over the rough seas to the outer reef where we dived with Sharks and a massive Grouper.  Our guide was a bit of a tool but he couldn`t speak when we were under water so it was all good.

</P><P>Apart from that we met some French girls (Celine and Cindy) who were good enough to do a BBQ for us (very nice it was too) and we passed many an hour sitting around with our goon playing poker.

</P><P>A wonderful part of the world and it was warm again.  Sydney next and so the jackets are being preped for wearing.</P><hr size='1'>
