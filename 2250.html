<H1>Diary for Dion and Duane</H1><hr size='1'><H2>The party capital</H2><H3>2007-05-02 to 2007-05-08</H3><P>So we appear early (far too early) in the party capital of Vietnam, Nha Trang, minus our previous travelling buddies and so in need of some more.  After some recuperative sleep we set out to explore the beach and surrounding town.  The fact you have to pay for a sunbed takes a bit of getting used too - it wouldn`t be allowed in India and so we resort to sitting on the sand.  The sea is warm and the beach is not too polluted and so we set off in search of a cheap, but safe looking diving centre. 
</P><P>
</P><P>Duane pays his money and so is set up on his 4 day open water diver course and i pay to join him on his four open water dives (the fact that i am already qualified i enjoying bragging about for the next few days.  What are friends for?)  So with Duane set for school the next day and the general lack of sleep catching up fast we get an early night. 
</P><P>
</P><P>What is there to do in Nha Trang apart from sitting on the beach?  Today my mission is to answer such a question.  I befriend an easy-rider who, in return for me thinking about taking his bike to Hanoi, gives me a tour of the sites.  Off to the Long Son Pagoda that is famous for its giant Budda on top of the hill and it`s lying Budda (a white copy of the Golden one in Bangkok) where i am eagerly shown round by one of the orphans that the monks look after and he even manages to convince me to buy some postcards for the good of his school (I`m looking after my Karma levels!).  Next on my tour was a drive past the fishing village to the Charm Towers, Hindu temples this time.  I feel, after experiencing the wonder of the temples in India, this particular set of temples was lost on me, it was also far too hot.  My guide left me at the Dam market where i wondered around explaining to people that i already have a "good morning Vietnam" T-shirt (for my more touristic days) and so another would just be greedy. 
</P><P>
</P><P>I had recently broken the screen of my camera (careless i know but it was it or me!) and so i got some directions from my landlord to a place that could help, commandeered a passing cyclo driver that could speak some English and went off to discuss repairs.  The chap, whilst sitting over a dismantled camera (fag in hand), informed my driver it could be fixed and i was invited back the next day.  My trust in Vietnamese workmanship was not high and so it was tentatively that i left my camera in the shop, receipt in hand (if that`s what it could be called) 
</P><P>
</P><P>Back home via the beach to find Duane back after a hard day learning about buoyancy and proving he could swim.  Time to eat and have a couple of drinks, but the heat and exertion of the day proved too much for the pair of us as we collapsed into a blissful sleep. 
</P><P>
</P><P>My easy-rider appears again, determined to take me to his shop (echos of India) and so, after using his services to do a few chores i have for the day, i pay lip service to the owner and promise to discuss the idea with Duane.  The camera is repaired.  Dare i say it better than new and so after many thank yous (a little piece of Vietnamese i have picked up) i rushed off to take as many photos as possible and kill the rest of the day on the beach (have i mentioned i hate beach holidays?!) 
</P><P>
</P><P>With the open water dives for both me and Duane approaching in the morning (i was in need of a refreshed) it was a case of early to bed, early to rise and we boarded our boat, manned by a crazy captain (think of a young Captain Ahab, but with both legs!) and we headed out for our dive in the beautiful, coral filled waters around Nha Trang.  On the way back to shore we started racing a much faster boat and so, due to his competitive streak, our captain chose to cut-up our pursuer causing an almighty collisions and both boats had to limp to shore.  This was followed the next day by the successful completion of duanes open water diver qualification and the necessary celebrations were commenced.  Due to this it was an early bedtime again and playful hangovers in the morning.
</P><P>
</P><P>Final day in Nha Trang and so we spent some time on the beach and wondered around the beachside cafes, drinking coffee.  Come the evening we met Susan (the German we met in Sapa) and some British (Alison, Gemma, Andrew and Alistair) and so h ad a good old fashioned British piss up before catching our bus the next evening to Ho Chi Minh City.  To the south we go.....................</P><hr size='1'>
