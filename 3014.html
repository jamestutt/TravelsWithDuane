<H1>Diary for Dion and Duane</H1><hr size='1'><H2>My kind of town, Chicago is</H2><H3>2007-09-19 to 2007-09-24</H3><P><P>Touchdown at Chicago`s O`Hare airport and we aree given another public transport system to negotiate.&nbsp; Fortunately, due to track repair works that put Englands to shame, crossing Chicago takes a good 3 hours.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>Eventually we find ourselves in the Loyolla universtiy part of the city.&nbsp; Tierd and unable to drink in our hostel we fall into a local bar.&nbsp; Being surrounded by drunk students all pretending to be 21 was fun for a while.&nbsp; Our waitress was lovely and had her friends rustle up the names of a couple of bars in town we might enjoy and some American lads gave us each a free bud-light (something to do with a promotion, but beggars can`t be choosers)</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>With money running out fast and the girls safely home it was time to revert to budget living - fortunately Chicago is a lovley city just to wander round.&nbsp; Massive buildings wherever the eye wanders and friendly locals who will be more then happy to point you in the right direction.&nbsp; One necessary expense was to indulge in one of Chicagos famous deep pan pizzas and it was lovely although i`m suer my life expectancy has been reduced dramatically.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>At night we discovered a free method of getting drunk.&nbsp; Along with our new freinds Mike and Guy we wandered student dorms and gatecrashed the first party we came across.&nbsp; The people were a little wary at first, but the British charm came out and the girls made us feel welcome (the guy`s kept there distance all night - it was a little awkward, vut at least there was no trouble.)</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>With Guy and Mike bing the sort of people who research places, we discovered we could go to the top of the Hankok building and only have to buy a drink (much cheaper than going to the observation deck and a floor higher) and when we got up there the service was so slow we were able to sneak out again.&nbsp; No better price than free.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>Havin managed to get ourselves invited to a costume party the next night we turned up ready for a crazy time, but it turns out all the students are Jesuits and so don`t really drink.&nbsp; That didn`t seem like a reason for us not to however, and so it was a&nbsp;fun night and only a couple of people asked if i knew the Queen.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>Chicago, i can`t remember what i expected but it was a lot better i`m sure.&nbsp; Great people, awesome food and&nbsp;beautiful parks along the lakes.&nbsp; What a skyline!!&nbsp; Let`s hope they get the olympics in 2016!</P></P><hr size='1'>
