<H1>Diary for Dion and Duane</H1><hr size='1'><H2>Sweet dreams my LAX</H2><H3>2007-08-30 to 2007-09-03</H3><P><P>Change of country, time zone and date.&nbsp; Que the longest day ever which caused Thursday to run for 42 hours.&nbsp; There seemed only one way to cope with such a body shattering experience and that was to invoke international jet-lag laws and have a drink (well before the 4 o`clock watershed!)&nbsp; With ourselves in a very American British pub we staring putting away the Guinness and then wandered along Santa Monica pier being terribly British and probably a little annoying.</P><P>With the required hangover settled in we planned our stay in LA.&nbsp; A trip down to Venice beach to see the street performers, Muscle beach (Duane and I decided not to work out)&nbsp;and some of the most honest beggars in the world - they only wanted money for weed!</P><P>When in LA you have to take on Hollywood and so we borded the bus (wonderful system, i don`t know what people complain about) and found the avenue of the stars.&nbsp; Tourist central and full of lookalikes (a poor attempet at Alistor Moody attempted to cast a spell on me - lets hope it didn`t work).&nbsp; Feeling like finding some stars we bought a map of there houses and hit Beverly Hills.&nbsp; Foudn the playboy mansion and wandered down Rodeo, but then decided enough was enough.&nbsp; We briefly visited the Tar pits where Mamoths had famously been found after they fell in and then went home.</P><P>Duane was determind to do something cultered in LA and so we went to the Getty.&nbsp; Lots of Americans crowded round something by Manet (wasn`t that good) and we saw lots of art.&nbsp; the building was the most impressive thing about the gallery.&nbsp; Spectacular architecture, with the promise of views of LA if the smog ever lifts.</P><P>LA the place of the beautiful people, cars and excessive heat.&nbsp; Time for a touch more culture as we head to&nbsp;`Frisco`</P></P><hr size='1'>
