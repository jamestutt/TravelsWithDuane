<H1>Diary for Dion and Duane</H1><hr size='1'><H2>Retreat in the mountains</H2><H3>2007-04-03 to 2007-04-04</H3><P>What with the heat, dust and general commotion of cities having surrounded us ever since we tore ourselves away from Goa; we decided to head to the hills for some much needed relaxation and tranquility.  Rishikesh seem like the ideal location (what with every well travelled hippie we met advising us in that general direction) and so off we went to the Ashram ridden hills.  The scenery was spectacular to say the least and when we arrived, just after sunrise, it was cold (20 degrees); if only i had brought my jumper with me.  This brief return to what a summer should be like didn`t last long though, as we headed off into the hills, badly equiped and lacking a sensible amount of water.
</P><P>
</P><P>Not to make the parents panic, we of course retreated back to town and had a dip in the Gangees (its not polluted this high up) and sat having a pleasant lunch listening to the religious ringing of bells.  The day progressed and we perused the local markets for anything we could possibly want.  Feeling it dangerous to buy anymore jewels for fear of falling into hippydom we decided it was best to escape the sun and catch up on some mythical characters.
</P><P>
</P><P>Come sunset the Ashram begin a religious light display and chant to the ringing of bells.  A very mystical experience with the sun disappearing behins the mountains turning the Gangees and eerie shade of Orange.  It then lead ti a cool night and so, after so long spent on trains, it was possible to get a good night sleep.
</P><P>
</P><P>More chanting at sunrise (do these people sleep?) and so up early when it`s cool.  After a hearty breakfast it was time for a bus ride to Saharanpur.  Two hours of being mostly on the wrong side of the road (i miss the trains).
</P><P>
</P><P>Saharanpur doesn`t appear in the guidebook and so, safe to say, we were the only tourists in the state (probably).  Incredibly busy and one of the most confusing train stations in the whole of the world, but eventually we find our train and head East towards Varanassi.</P><hr size='1'>
