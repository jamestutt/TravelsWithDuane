<H1>Diary for Dion and Duane</H1><hr size='1'><H2>Saigon</H2><H3>2007-05-09 to 2007-05-14</H3><P>Without hesitation we were drawn to the Museum of American War Crimes (re-named The War Remnants Museum so as not to offend the delicate sensibilities of a dollar spending nation). Emotive photos and big guns all carefully positioned to transform groups of mellow pacafists into angry lynch mobs that hurriedly pursue groups of fanny-packed tourists around the boulevards of HCMC. In order to collect our thoughts and sharpen our pitchforks we ducked into a bar for a coffee. If Saigon had an underground maffia fit for a Quentin Tarentino film then this certainly was where it hung out. The place was packed with Vitnamese man in sharp, tailored suits being waited upon by skimply-but-tastefuly-dressed girls and the whole show was delightfully choreographed to unusual flourishes of Vietnamese hip-hop amongst a backdrop of British pop. After politely pointing out to the waitress that we were not American we were provided with endless cups of tea. Later we bumped into a chap in the park with whom we had been brinking with in Nha Trang and after setting a time and place for dinner, pointed us in the direction of the (Re?)unification Palace. Once the seat of government in the days of South Viet Nam the place had been left, like the Mary Celeste , exactly as it was fled from as the tanks rolled through the gates in `75. Very interesting place not least as an essay in 1960s architecture, fixtures and fittings. Wondering back, having aquired a pair of Cambodian visas from the local embassy, we nipped into Notre Dame de Sai Gon where my sensitive travelling companion was horrified to find a kitsch sculpture of notre Dame above the alter behaloed with a neon light and "Ave Maria" written across her chest in pink, neon tubbing. After such iconoclastic visions we quickly scuttled back to the travellers quarter to make ourselves ready for dinner. Dinner was a grand affair since we had contacted all the people we knew to be in Saigon and rquested their company at our table. The night lasted well into itself and after an abortive attempt by me to lead a team into the heart of darkness (Apocalypse Now - a club - was closed by the time we arrived) the early hours found us in the company of Gemma (GB), Susan (D) and Nick (D) laconicaly drinking rum in the Go, Go, Go Bar.</P><hr size='1'>
